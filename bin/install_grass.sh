#  A script to install GRASS GIS 7.
#    written by H.Bowman <hamish_b  yahoo com>
#    GRASS homepage: http://grass.osgeo.org/
#
# This does not attempt to install QGIS-plugin infrastructure, that is
#  done in install_qgis.sh. Your QGIS packages will have to have been
#  built with grass7-enabled plugins.
#
# It assumes the GRASS 6 livedvd install script has already been run,
#  the two versions can co-exist.
#
# ***
# This script is intended to be run by the User on an existing live disc,
#  Not at build time of the disc -- that will come when grass 7.0 is
#  released and in the stable repositories. The North Carolina GRASS 7
#  sample dataset will also be downloaded and installed. A result of all
#  this is that users of a non-persistent ISO boot will have everything
#  on the RAM drive, which may be quite limited to begin with depending
#  on your computer's available RAM. Users with >2gb RAM shouldn't have
#  to worry, but those on old netbooks might. If run from a persistent VM
#  or 8gb USB things should be ok too.
# ***
#
# It should be run as the superuser (sudo).
