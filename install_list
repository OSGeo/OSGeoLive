# This file contains a list of projects with install_X.sh scripts and 
# and documentation to install
# Projects can be commented out of this list to prevent their docs from being installed
# TODO: Use this list to control installation of package and order of installation
#
# Other installers, like install_java are called directly
# from the main.sh script
#
# install order:
#  1. Base packages (called from main.sh)
#  2. Java apps
#  3. PostGIS apps
#  4. Desktop GIS apps
#  5. LiveDVD desktop, docs, etc. (called from main.sh)
#  6. Cleanup scripts (called from main.sh)

# Currently in alphabetical order for documentation autogeneration
# TODO: implement more sophisticated build control and documentation category generation
#   (... now fixed?)
