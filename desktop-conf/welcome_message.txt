Welcome to the OSGeo Live GIS DVD.


See the road-sign Help icon on the Desktop for information about
the Live disc and virtual-machine, including a synopsis of bundled
geospatial packages and a series of quick-start short tutorials.

To change the language, log out (Applications menu) and along the
bottom of the login screen is the language menu.  Once you log back
in (the password if you need it is "user"), there is a flag icon on
the top menu bar that lets you pick the keyboard layout. You can
also set it via the menus with Applications > System > Language
Support.

Program installers for Macintosh OSX and Microsoft Windows can be
found in the MacInstallers and WindowsInstallers directories.

Passwords for various things can be found in the passwords.txt file
on the Desktop.

If you need to become "root" (the UNIX super-user) open a Terminal
and type "sudo su", then enter "user" as the password.
