Welcome to OSGeoLive 15.0

See the Help icon on the Desktop for information about the
OSGeoLive disc and virtual-machine, including a synopsis of bundled
geospatial packages and a series of quick-start short tutorials.

There is a keyboard icon on the lower menu bar that lets you pick the 
keyboard layout. See the internationalization quickstart in the 
OSGeoLive help pages for more information.

Passwords for various things can be found in the passwords.txt file
on the Desktop.

If you need to become "root" (the UNIX super-user) open a Terminal
and type "sudo su", then enter "user" as the password if you are
asked.

The living FAQ can be found here:

Happy mapping!
