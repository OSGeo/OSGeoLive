Welcome to OSGeo-Live 12.0beta1.


See the road-sign Help icon on the Desktop for information about the        
Live disc and virtual-machine, including a synopsis of bundled
geospatial packages and a series of quick-start short tutorials.

To change the language, log out (lower menu bar), enter the user name
"user", click on the password box below it to confirm the user name,
and along the top of the login window is a language drop-down menu
which starts as "en_US". After selecting the language finish entering
the password (it's also "user") and press the "Log In" button. If it
doesn't work the first time just log out and try again.

Once you log back in, there is a keyboard icon on the lower menu bar
that lets you pick the keyboard layout. You can also set it via the
main applications menu with Preferences > Language Support and
Preferences > Keyboard Input Methods. See the internationalization
quickstart in the OSGeo Live help pages for more information.

Passwords for various things can be found in the passwords.txt file
on the Desktop.

If you need to become "root" (the UNIX super-user) open a Terminal
and type "sudo su", then enter "user" as the password if you are
asked.
