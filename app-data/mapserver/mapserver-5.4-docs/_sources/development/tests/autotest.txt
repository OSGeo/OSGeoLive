The msautotest is a suite of test maps, data files, expected result images,
and test scripts intended to make it easy to run an a set of automated
regression tests on MapServer.

Getting msautotest
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The autotest is available from SVN. On Unix it could be fetched something like:

::

    % svn checkout http://svn.osgeo.org/mapserver/trunk/msautotest

This would create an msautotest subdirectory whereever you are. I normally put
the autotest within my MapServer directory.

Running msautotest
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The autotest requires python (but not python MapScript), so if you don't have
python on your system - get and install it. More information on python is
available at http://www.python.org. Most Linux system have some version
already installed.

The autotest also requires that the executables built with MapServer, notably
:ref:`shp2img`, :ref:`legend <legend_utility>`, :ref:`mapserv` and
:ref:`scalebar <scalebar_utility>`, are available in the path. I generally
accomplish this by adding the MapServer build directory to my path.

csh::

 % setenv PATH $HOME/mapserver:$PATH

bash/sh::

 % PATH=$HOME/mapserver:$PATH

Verify that you can run stuff by typing 'shp2img -v' in the autotest
directory::

     warmerda@gdal2200[152]% shp2img -v
     MapServer version 3.7 (development) OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=JPEG OUTPUT=WBMP 
     SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=TTF SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER SUPPORTS=GD2_RGB 
     INPUT=TIFF INPUT=EPPL7 INPUT=JPEG INPUT=OGR INPUT=GDAL INPUT=SHAPEFILE

Now you are ready to run the tests. The tests are subdivided into categories,
currently just "gdal", "misc", and "wxs" each as a subdirectory. To run the
"gdal" tests cd into the gdal directory and run the run_test.py script.

Unix::

  ./run_test.py 

Windows::

  python.exe run_test.py

The results in the misc directory might look something like this::

 warmerda@gdal2200[164]% run_test.py
 version = MapServer version 3.7 (development) OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=JPEG OUTPUT=WBMP
 SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=TTF SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER SUPPORTS=GD2_RGB INPUT=TIFF 
 INPUT=EPPL7 INPUT=JPEG INPUT=OGR INPUT=GDAL INPUT=SHAPEFILE

 Processing: rgba_scalebar.map
    results match.
 Processing: tr_scalebar.map
    results match.
 Processing: tr_label_rgb.map
    results match.
 Processing: ogr_direct.map
    results match.
 Processing: ogr_select.map
    results match.
 Processing: ogr_join.map
    results match.
 Test done:
    0 tested skipped
    6 tests succeeded
    0 tests failed
    0 test results initialized

In general you are hoping to see that no tests failed.

Checking Failures
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because most msautotest tests are comparing generated images to expected
images, the tests are very sensitive to subtle rounding differences on
different systems, and subtle rendering changes in libraries like freetype
and gd. So it is quite common to see some failures.

These failures then need to be reviewed manually to see if the differences
are acceptable and just indicating differences in rounding/rendering or
whether they are "real" bugs. This is normally accomplished by visually
comparing files in the "result" directory with the corrresponding file in
the "expected" directory. It is best if this can be done in an application
that allows images to be layers, and toggled on and off to visually
highlight what is changing. OpenEV can be used for this.

PerceptualDiff
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you install the PerceptualDiff program (http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/) and
it is in the path, then the autotest will attempt to use it as a last fallback
when comparing images. If images are found to be "perceptually" the same the
test will pass with the message "result images perceptually match, though
files differ." This can dramatically cut down the number of apparent failures
that on close inspection are for all intents and purposes identical. Building
PerceptualDiff is a bit of a hassle.

Background
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The msautotest suite was initially developed by Frank Warmerdam
(warmerdam at pobox.com), who can be contacted with questions it.

The msautotest suite is organized as a series of .map files. The python
scripts basically scan the directory in which they are run for files ending in
.map. They are then "run" with the result dumped into a file in the result
directory. A binary comparison is then done to the corresponding file in the
expected directory and differences are reported. The general principles for
the test suite are that:

- The test data should be small so it can be easily stored and checked out of
  svn without big files needing to be downloaded.

- The test data should be completely contained within the test suite ... no
  dependencies on external datasets, or databases that require additional
  configuration. PostGIS and Oracle will require separate testing mechanisms.

- The tests should be able to run without a significant deal of user
  interaction. This is as distinct from the DNR test suite described in
  FunctionalityDemo.

- The testing mechanism should be suitable to test many detailed functions in
  relative isolation.

- The test suite is not dependent on any of the MapScript environments, though
  I think it would be valuable to extend the testsuite with some mapscript
  dependent components in the future (there is a start on this in the mspython
  directory).

Test Script Internal Functioning
..............................................................................

Because MapServer can be built with many possible extensions, such as support
for OGR, GDAL, and PROJ.4, it is desirable to have the testsuite automatically
detect which tests should be run based on the configuratio of MapServer. This
is accomplished by capturing the version output of "shp2img -v" and using the
various keys in that to decide which tests can be run. A directory can have a
file called "all_require.txt" with a "REQUIRES:" line indicating components
required for all tests in the directory. If any of these requirements are not
met, no tests at all will be run in this directory. For instance, the
gdal/all_require.txt lists:

::

    REQUIRES: INPUT=GDAL OUTPUT=PNG

In addition, individual .map files can have additional requirements expressed
as a REQUIRES: comment in the mapfile. If the requirements are not met the map
will be skipped (and listsed in the summary as a skipped test). For example
gdal/256_overlay_res.map has the following line to indicate it requires
projection support (in addition to the INPUT=GDAL and OUTPUT=PNG required by
all files in the directory):

::

    REQUIRES: SUPPORTS=PROJ

The output files generated by processing a map is put in the file
results/<mapfilebasename>.png (regardless of whether it is PNG or not). So
when gdal/256_overlay_res.map is processed, the output file is written to
gdal/results/256_overlay_res.png. This is compared to
gdal/expected/256_overlay_res.png. If they differ the test fails, and the
"wrong" result file is left behind for investigation. If they match the result
file is deleted. If there is no corresponding expected file the results file
is moved to the expected directory (and reported as an "initialized" test)
ready to be committed to CVS.

There is also a RUN_PARMS keyword that may be placed in map files to override
a bunch of behaviour. The default behaviour is to process map files with
shp2img, but other programs such as mapserv or scalebar can be requested, and
various commandline arguments altered as well as the name of the output file.
For instance, the following line in misc/tr_scalebar.map indicates that the
output file should be called tr_scalebar.png, the commandline should look like
"[SCALEBAR] [MAPFILE] [RESULT]" instead of the default "[SHP2IMG] -m [MAPFILE]
-o [RESULT]".
 
::

    RUN_PARMS: tr_scalebar.png [SCALEBAR] [MAPFILE] [RESULT]

For testing things as they would work from an HTTP request, use the RUN_PARMS
with the program [MAPSERV] and the QUERY_STRING argument, with results
redirected to a file.

::

    # RUN_PARMS: wcs_cap.xml [MAPSERV] QUERY_STRING='map=[MAPFILE]&SERVICE=WCS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities' > [RESULT]

For web services that generate images that would normally be prefixed with the
Content-type header, use [RESULT_NOMIME] to instruct the test harnass to
script off any http headers before doing the comparison.

::

    # Generate simple PNG.
    # RUN_PARMS: wcs_simple.png [MAPSERV] QUERY_STRING='map=[MAPFILE]&SERVICE=WCS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCoverage&WIDTH=120&HEIGHT=90&FORMAT=GDPNG&BBOX=0,0,400,300&COVERAGE=grey&CRS=EPSG:32611' > [RESULT_DEMIME]

What If A Test Fails?
..............................................................................

When running the test suite, it is common for some tests to fail depending on
vagaries of floating point on the platform, or harmless changes in
MapServer. To identify these compare the results in result with the file in
expected and determine what the differences are. If there is just a slight
shift in text or other features it is likely due to floating point differences
on different platforms. These can be ignored. If something has gone seriously
wrong, then track down the problem!

It is also prudent to avoid using output image formats that are platform
specific. For instance, if you produce TIFF it will generate big endian on big
endian systems and therefore be different at the binary level from what was
expected. PNG should be pretty safe.

TODO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add lots of tests for different stuff!  Very little vector testing done yet. 

- Add a high level script in the msautotest directory that runs the subscripts
  in all the subdirectories and produces a summary report.

Adding New Tests
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Pick an appropriate directory to put the test in. Feel free to start a new
  one for new families of testing functionality.

- Create a minimal map file to test a particular issue. I would discourage
  starting from a "real" mapfile and cutting down as it is hard to reduce this
  to the minimum.

- Give the new mapfile a name that hints at what it is testing without making
  the name too long. For instance "ogr_join.map" tests OGR joins.
  "rgb_overlay_res_to8bit.map" tests RGB overlay layers with resampling and
  converting to 8bit output.

- Put any MapServer functionality options in a # REQUIRES: item in the header
  as described in the internal functioning topic above.

- Write some comments at the top of the .map file on what this test is
  intended to check.

- Add any required datasets within the data directory beneath the test
  directory. These test datasets should be as small as possible! Reuse
  existing datasets if at all possible.

- run the "run_tests.py" script.  

- verify that the newly created expected/<testname>.png file produces the
  results you expect. If not, revise the map and rerun the test, now checking
  the results/<testname>.png file. Move the results/<testname>.png file into
  the expected directory when you are happy with it.
 
- add the .map file, and the expected/<testname>.png file to CVS when you are
  happy with them. Make sure the .png file (and any supporting data files) are
  marked as binary files. For example,

::

    % svn add mynewtest.map expected/mynewtest.png
    % svn commit -m "new" mynewtest.map expected/mynewtest.png
 
You're done!
