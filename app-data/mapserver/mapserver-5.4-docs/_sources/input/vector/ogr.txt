Introduction
============

Starting with version 3.5, MapServer included the ability to access vector
data sets in formats other than Shapefile in their native format using the OGR
library. The following document describes the process for implementing OGR
support within MapServer applications.

.. note::
    
    Experimental OGR support was included in MapServer version 3.4 but this
    initial implementation had some limitations and is not covered in this
    document.

This document assumes that you are already familiar with certain aspects of
MapServer:

- MapServer application development and especially setting up :ref:`.map files
  <mapfile>`.

- Some compilation skills if you don't have ready access to a pre-compiled
  installation and need to compile your own copy of MapServer with OGR
  support.
  
- access to OGR utilities, such as *ogrinfo*, which are available in the
  `FWTools`_ and `MS4W`_ packages.
                      
Readers should also check out the :ref:`Vector Data Access Guide <vector>`,
which has lots of examples of how to access specific vector formats.
                        
What is OGR?
============

The OGR Simple Features Library is a C++ open source library (and command-line
tools) providing read (and sometimes write) access to a variety of vector file
formats including ESRI Shapefiles, and MapInfo mid/mif and TAB formats.

OGR is actually part of the GDAL library, so you will notice that some
references point to GDAL (such as the mailing list).

What Does OGR Add to MapServer?
-------------------------------

The OGR Simple Features Library allows MapServer users to display several
types of vector data files in their native formats. For example, MapInfo
Mid/Mif and TAB data do not need to be converted to ESRI shapefiles when using
OGR support with MapServer.

What Data Formats are Supported?
--------------------------------

See http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_formats.html for the latest list of supported
formats. At the date this document was written, the following formats were
supported:

- `ArcInfo Binary Coverages`_
- `ArcInfo E00 Coverages`_
- `Atlas BNA`_
- `Comma Separated Value (.csv)`_
- `DODS/OPeNDAP`_
- `ESRI ArcSDE`_
- `ESRI Personal GeoDatabase`_
- `ESRI Shapefiles`_
- `FMEObjects Gateway`_
- `Géoconcept Export`_
- `GeoJSON`_
- `GeoRSS`_
- `GML`_
- `GMT`_  
- `GRASS`_
- `GPX`_
- `Informix DataBlade`_
- `INGRES`_
- `INTERLIS`_
- `KML`_
- `MapInfo files`_
- `Memory`_
- `Microstation DGN files`_
- `MySQL`_
- `ODBC`_
- `OGDI Vectors`_
- `Oracle Spatial`_
- `PostgreSQL`_
- `SDTS`_
- `SQLite`_
- `UK.NTF (National Transfer Format)`_
- `US Census TIGER/Line`_
- `VRT - Virtual Datasource`_
- `X-Plane/Flighgear aeronautical data`_

.. note:: 

    Some of the above formats (e.g. OGDI) have external dependencies and are
    not always included in the pre-compiled binary distributions of MapServer
    with OGR support.*

.. note::

    Some of the above formats are not well suited for random access by nature,
    that's the case of MapInfo MIF/MID files which is a TEXT format and will
    give very poor performance for a web application. On the other hand, some
    binary formats such as MapInfo TAB are better suited for random access and
    will give performance comparable to native shapefile access in MapServer.*

How to Get More Information on the OGR Project
----------------------------------------------

- More information on the OGR Simple Features Project can be found at 
  http://www.gdal.org/ogr/.

- The `GDAL mailing list`_ can be used for OGR related questions. Always
  search the list archives before sending new questions.

- The `GDAL Wiki`_ has lots of good information for users and developers.

- The #gdal IRC channel on irc.freenode.net might also be of help.  For info
  on IRC see the :ref:`MapServer IRC page <irc>`.

The main developer of the OGR library is Frank Warmerdam and the 
integration of OGR within MapServer was done by Daniel Morissette.

Obtaining and Compiling MapServer with OGR Support
==================================================

- Follow the instructions on the `OGR page`_ to compile/install OGR/GDAL.

- Obtain the MapServer :ref:`source <download>`.

For UNIX users, see the README.CONFIGURE file in the MapServer source, or see
the :ref:`UNIX Compilation and Installation <unix>`. If GDAL/OGR is normally
installed it should be sufficient to add --with-ogr to the configure line
before (re)building MapServer. Linux users might want to try `FGS`_, a Linux
installer for MapServer.

For Windows users, it is recommended to look for a pre-compiled binary on the
MapServer site (`MS4W`_ is recommended). If you want to compile your own
then see the README.WIN32 file in the MapServer source.

Integrating OGR Support with MapServer Applications
===================================================

The only change that is needed to integrate OGR support with a MapServer
application is with the .map file. The LAYER's DATA parameter is expanded to
three parameters (CONNECTIONTYPE OGR, CONNECTION and DATA).

The syntax for this differs depending on the type of data being used (the
:ref:`Vector Data Access Guide <vector>` is an excellent resource for this).
In OGR, a data source can be either a set of files that share a common
basename (e.g. .shp/.shx/.dbf for ArcView Shapefiles, or
.tab/.map/.dat/.ind/.id for MapInfo TAB files) or a whole directory of files
(e.g. TIGER).

Let's call the former "File-based data sources" and the later "Directory-based
data sources". When accessing a **file-based data source** you specify the
filename of one of the files in the set (e.g. roads.shp or roads.tab) and when
accessing a **directory-based data source** you specify the directory name and
OGR reads all the files in the directory as a single data source with
potentially several layers (e.g. TIGER files).

Some OGR drivers (e.g. SHP, TAB) can have dual behaviors, that is if they're
pointed to a single file then they behave as a file-based data source and if
they're pointed to a directory then they will behave as a directory-based data
source and then every file in the directory becomes a new layer in the data
source.

See the `OGR formats page`_ for more info on the specific file format you're
using. (Click on the format name for more specific driver info on that format)

Using OGR Data Sources in the Map File
--------------------------------------

The .map file LAYER definition for file-based sources is as follows:

.. code-block:: mapfile

      LAYER
         ...
         CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
         CONNECTION "<datasource_name>"
         DATA "<layer_definition>"
         ...
      END
              

**<datasource_name>** is the name of the datasource to read from and is
prefixed by the CONNECTION keyword. The exact organization depends on the
format driver in use. The format driver to use is automatically selected by
OGR based on the nature of the string passed as the datasource, and/or the
format of the file referenced by it.


  - For file based datasources this is the name of the file, including the
    extension, using an absolute path, or a relative path. Relative paths are
    interpreted relative to the SHAPEPATH first, if not found then we try
    again relative to the .map file location. 
    
    .. note:: 
        
        Before version 4.1 the SHAPEPATH was ignored for OGR datasources.

  - For directory based datasources, such as TIGER/Line, or Arc/Info Binary
    Coverages this is the name of the directory containing the files. If the
    path is relative it is interpreted relative to the .map file.

  - For virtual datasources such as database systems, and OGDI this is the
    service connection string and is generally not related to the filesystem.
    For instance, for Oracle Spatial this might be
    "OCI:warmerda/Password@gdal800.velocet.ca".

**<layer_definition>** is the name, number or SQL definition of the layer to
use from the datasource. It is indicated via the DATA keyword in the map file.

  - Layer Name: The (case insenstive) layer name may be used to select a
    layer.

  - Layer Number: The layer number (starting from 0 for the first layer) may
    be used to select a layer. Generally the layer name is preferred to this
    since it is more self describing.

  - Omitted: If no DATA keyword is provided, this is equivalent to selecting
    layer 0.

  - SQL SELECT: If an SQL SELECT statement is used, it is interpreted in a
    driver specific manner to try and generate a temporary pseudo-layer. For
    some formats this a restricted subset of SQL is interpreted within OGR.
    For RDBMS based drivers (such as PostGIS and Oracle) this is passed
    through to the underlying database.

The OGRINFO utility can be used to find out the list of layers and their names
in a data source.

Examples of Layer Definitions Using OGR
---------------------------------------

Please see the :ref:`Vector Data Access Guide <vector>` for details and
examples of each data format supported.

**Example 1. MapInfo TAB file**

.. code-block:: mapfile

      LAYER
         NAME "Builtup_Areas_tab"
         TYPE POLYGON
         CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
         CONNECTION "data/tab/092b06_builtup_a.tab"
         STATUS ON
         CLASS
           ...
         END
      ...
      END
               
**Example 2. Microstation DGN file using <layer_index>**

The entire DGN file is represented in OGR as one layer (see the `DGN driver
page`_ for more details):

.. code-block:: mapfile

      LAYER
         NAME "dgn"
         TYPE LINE
         CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
         CONNECTION "dgn/santabarbara02.dgn"
         DATA "0"
         STATUS ON
         STYLEITEM "AUTO"
         CLASS
         END
      END # Layer
               
**Example 3. TIGER/Line file using <layer_name>**

.. code-block:: mapfile

      LAYER
         NAME "Roads_tig"
         TYPE line
         CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
         CONNECTION "full/path/to/tiger/TGR25001"
         DATA "CompleteChain"
         STATUS ON
         CLASS
           ...
         END
      END
               
**Example 4. Directory of Shapefiles using SQL JOIN**

.. code-block:: mapfile

      LAYER
         NAME "Parks_cov"
         TYPE POLYGON
         CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
         CONNECTION "data/shppoly"
         DATA "SELECT eas_id, idlink.Name FROM poly LEFT JOIN idlink ON poly.eas_id = idlink.eas_id"
         STATUS ON
         CLASSITEM "idlink.Name"
         CLASS
           ...
         END
      END
               
How to Use "OGRINFO"
--------------------

OGRINFO is part of the GDAL/OGR distribution (it is also included in `FWTools`_ 
and `MS4W`_). It is an executable that can be used to obtain layer information 
about OGR supported files. The parameters are:

  *ogrinfo* [-ro] [-q] datasource_name [layer [layer...]]
      
  - -ro opens the file as read only (optional)

  - -q executes in quiet mode, only the layer idex line will be returned (optional)

  - datasource_name is the filename including extension (eg. roads.tab); for 
    TIGER/Line files, datasource_name is the directory containing the TIGER 
    files (eg. ogrinfo TGR25001) 


**Example 5. To get the list of layers in a file:**

::

    $ ogrinfo  popplace.tab

    Had to open data source read-only.
    INFO: Open of `popplace.tab'
    using driver `MapInfo File' successful.
    1: popplace (Point)
          

which shows that there is one point layer in the popplace.tab file.

**Example 6. To get a dump of a specific layer, including field names, projection, etc:**

::

    $ ogrinfo popplace.tab popplace

    Had to open data source read-only.
    INFO: Open of `popplace.tab'
    using driver `MapInfo File' successful.

      NAME (String) = Hopedale

    ...
    ...
                

**Example 7. To get a list of layers in a TIGER/Line Directory:**

::

    $ ogrinfo TGR25001
  
    Had to open data source read-only.
    INFO: Open of `TGR25001'
    using driver `TIGER' successful.

    12: PIP (Point)
    13: TLIDRange (None)
    14: ZipPlus4 (None)       
          

The above example shows that there are 14 layers in the TGR25001 directory.               

**Example 8. To get a summary of a specific TIGER layer, including only field names, projection, and extent**

Queries Through OGR Format
--------------------------

OGR layers can be queried the same way as regular shapefiles in MapServer.

TILEINDEX with OGR
------------------

OGR layers can utilize tile indexes in a similar fashion to Shapefile based 
layers. The TILEINDEX keyword should contain the connection string for the tile 
index file. The tile index file may be any supported OGR format, including 
shapefiles.

The TILEITEM keyword in the LAYER definition indicates what attribute from the 
tile index file should be used as the datasource location. If omitted, the default 
TILEITEM value is "location". The value in the location field should be a connection 
string the same as would have been used in the CONNECTION field for OGR layers. 
The CONNECTION keyword is not needed (and will be ignored) for layers using the 
OGR connection type and having the TILEINDEX keyword.

Tileindex files can be prepared in an external GIS, or using the OGR utility 
ogrtindex. Details can be found on the `OGR Utilities Page`_.

The following is a simple example of a point layer using a tile index.

.. code-block:: mapfile

   LAYER
     NAME "ogr_points"
     TYPE POINT
     CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
     TILEINDEX "PIP_ogr_tiles.shp,0"
     STATUS ON
     CLASS
        NAME "points"
        STYLE
          SYMBOL "default-circle"
          COLOR 255 0 0
          SIZE 6
        END
     END
   END

OGR tileindex layers should support all normal query and attribute fetching
mechanisms, including from MapScript; however, this has not been heavily
tested as of April/2002. Please report problems via the MapServer Trac. If
auto projection support is used for tileindexed OGR layers, the tileindex is
read for the projection (not the component tiles). Problems may (or may not)
be encountered if the component tiles have differing schemas (different sets
of attributes).

Connection Pooling
------------------

For some OGR supported formats, connecting to the dataset is quite expensive
in terms of CPU use and amount of disk IO. For instance, establishing access
to an S-57 dataset results in a complete read into memory of the data files.
Connection pooling control aims at reducing this overhead in situations where
the same file is used for several different map layers.

To ensure that an OGR supported dataset is only opened once per map render
(instead of separately for each map LAYER referencing the dataset, use the
CLOSE_CONNECTION PROCESSING option. The default value is for CLOSE_CONNECTION
is NORMAL, but if set to DEFER the dataset will be kept open till the map
render is complete. It will be reused by any other layers with using the same
datasource.

**Example 9. Preserve S-57 connection for two layers**

In this example, we are using the same dataset (NO410810.000) for two layers. To 
avoid re-reading the dataset, we mark the first layer to defer closing the connection 
till layer. In the second (or last) layer we request NORMAL connection handling 
(though this could have been left out as normal handling is the default).

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
       NAME "AdminAreas"
       TYPE POLYGON
       CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
       CONNECTION "NO410810.000"
       DATA "ADMARE"
       PROCESSING "CLOSE_CONNECTION=DEFER"
       STATUS ON
       ...
    END
    LAYER
       NAME "Land Areas"
       TYPE POLYGON
       CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
       CONNECTION "NO410810.000"
       DATA "LNDARE"
       PROCESSING "CLOSE_CONNECTION=NORMAL"
       STATUS ON
       ...
    END

1. The text of the CONNECTION keyword must match exactly between layers for the 
   connection to be reused.
   
2. Some dataset connections are quite memory expensive, and keeping them open 
   may result in increased memory use.
   
3. If all layers rendered for a particular connection defer closing the connection, 
   it will remain open till MapServer terminates. For normal cgi or MapScript 
   use this is likely OK.
   
4. This use of CLOSE_CONNECTION handling is unique to OGR layers, and may be 
   changed at some point in the future as part of a broader implementation of 
   connection pooling in MapServer.
   
STYLEITEM "AUTO" - Rendering Layers Using Style Information from the OGR File
=============================================================================


.. note::

    This feature is only supported with MapInfo TAB and Microstation DGN files
    at the moment, but eventually other formats that carry colors and styles
    at the shape-level may also be supported through OGR.*

In MapServer, ArcView, and other shapefile-based applications, colors and styles 
are usually defined at the layer level. This means that all the shapes in a given 
layer are usually rendered using the same color and styles.

On the other hand, some formats supported by OGR such as MapInfo TAB do have color 
and style information attached to each shape. OGR adds support for the 
'STYLEITEM "AUTO"' layer parameter which allows you to request that the shapes in 
a layer be rendered using colors and styles coming from the data source instead of 
being driven by CLASSes as was traditionally done with MapServer.

How to Implement
----------------

In order to have a layer rendered using colours and styles coming from the OGR data 
source, your must do the following:

- Your layer definition must contain the STYLEITEM "AUTO" parameter.

- Your layer definition needs to contain at least one CLASS (which may be empty) 
  and optionally a CLASSITEM to match the expressions if your CLASS contains an 
  expression. The empty CLASS in the layer will be updated dynamically at runtime 
  to contain colours and styles coming from the data source for each shape. 

Examples
--------

**Example 10. Layer Definition Using STYLEITEM "AUTO" without a CLASSITEM**

.. code-block:: mapfile


    LAYER
       NAME "test_dgn"
       STATUS ON
       TYPE POLYGON
       CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
       CONNECTION "../data/dgn/test.dgn"

       # This enables use of colors and styles from the source file.
       STYLEITEM "AUTO"

       # Define an empty class that will be filled at runtime from the color and
       # styles read on each shape in the source file.
       CLASS
       END
   END  # layer
                    

**Example 11. Layer Definition Using STYLEITEM "AUTO" with a CLASSITEM**

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
       NAME "Builtup_Areas_tab"
       TYPE POLYGON
       CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
       CONNECTION "data/tab/092b06_builtup_a.tab"
       STATUS ON

       # This enables use of colors and styles from the source file.
       STYLEITEM "AUTO"

       # Define an empty class that will be filled at runtime from the color and
       # styles read on each shape in the source file.
       CLASSITEM "CATEGORY"
       CLASS
          EXPRESSION "1"
       END
    END     
      

**Please Note:**

CLASS EXPRESSIONs are still working, so it is still possible to query and 
classify layers that are using STYLEITEM "AUTO". The only difference is that instead 
of using static class definitions, the colors and style will be read from the data 
file.

Important Notes
---------------

:NOTE 1: Even though MapInfo and other OGR data sources may support layers with mixed 
         geometry types (e.g. points, lines and polygons in the same file) this is 
         not yet supported in MapServer. So you still have to define a layer 'TYPE' 
         and make sure that all the shapes in the OGR data source are compatible with 
         that layer type, otherwise MapServer may produce an error about incompatible 
         geometry types at runtime.

:NOTE 2: Due to the dynamic nature of this feature, it is not compatible with the 
         labelcache, so the labelcache is automatically disabled for layers that make 
         use of 'STYLEITEM "AUTO"'.

:NOTE 3: When you use STYLEITEM AUTO, MapServer tries to match symbol names returned 
         by OGR to names in your symbol file. For a quick solution, try using the 
         following symbol file:

http://www2.dmsolutions.ca/msapps/yk_demo/etc/symbols_mapinfo.sym

The name of the symbols returned by OGR to MapServer depends on the file format. In the 
case of MapInfo files, it will be:

- For "old-style" symbols (default MapInfo 3.0 symbols numbered 32 to 67) the symbol 
  name will be 'mapinfo-sym-##' where '##' is the symbol number, e.g. 'mapinfo-sym-32'. 

- For "Font Symbols", the symbol name is also 'mapinfo-sym-##' where '##' is the 
  symbol number in the font. In this case, the name of the font itself is ignored by 
  MapServer. 

- MapInfo also supports "custom symbols" (bitmap symbols)... I'm not sure what you 
  would get from OGR for this, but I'm pretty sure that MapServer doesn't do anything 
  useful with them. 

The OGRINFO utility can be used to find out exactly which symbol names OGR will 
return to MapServer. Look at the "Style" string in the ogrinfo output for each shape 
that is read.

Mapping of OGR Style Info to the MapServer CLASS Members
--------------------------------------------------------

Here is the list of style parameters that are currently supported from OGR data sources 
and how they're mapped in MapServer:

Line color
  The line colour is mapped to CLASS.COLOR 
    
Line thickness
  The line thickness is mapped to CLASS.STYLE.WIDTH. The default will be 1 pixel line (as 
  it always is with MapServer).
  
Polygon fill color
  Polygon fill color is mapped directly to CLASS.COLOR
          
  Note that at this time, transparent polygons are not supported (they're always
  opaque).

Polygon outline
    If a polygon has an outline color and thickness defined in the data source 
    then the same rule as for line color and thickness above will apply, except 
    that the outline color is mapped to CLASS.OUTLINECOLOR 

Point symbols
    Point symbol color is directly mapped to CLASS.COLOR
    Point symbol size is directly mapped to CLASS.SIZE
                   
    If your symbolset contains a symbol called "default-marker" then this symbol 
    will be used, otherwise the default will be CLASS.SYMBOL=0 (i.e. a 1 pixel dot)

    It is also possible (with a bit of work) to control which symbol gets used 
    in rendering point symbols. OGR provides MapServer with symbol names, and 
    if the symbol name returned by OGR to MapServer matches the name of one of 
    the symbols in your symbolset then this symbol will be used.

    For MapInfo point symbols (numbered 32 to 67 in the MapInfo MIF spec), the name 
    returned by OGR is "mapinfo-sym-X" where X should be replaced with the MapInfo 
    symbol number (e.g. "mapinfo-sym-35" is the star symbol). 
    
Text labels
    The text string is mapped to CLASS.TEXT
    
    Text color is mapped to CLASS.LABEL.COLOR
    
    Text background color is mapped to CLASS.LABEL.BACKGROUNDCOLOR
    
    Text height is mapped to CLASS.LABEL.SIZE
    
    Text angle is mapped to CLASS.LABEL.ANGLE
          

    Text font mapping follows the following rules:

    1. If TTF fonts are supported:
       
       a. If the native font name (e.g. "Arial") is found in your fontset then this 
          font will be used.

       b. If 1a. failed and a font called "default" is present in your fontset then 
          this "default" font will be used. 
          
    2. If TTF fonts are not supported or if all above cases failed, then BITMAP 
       MEDIUM font will be used.

Accessing OGR STYLEITEMAUTO Label Styles Through MapScript
----------------------------------------------------------

OGR STYLEITEMAUTO label styles can be accessed through MapScript, such as 
PHP/MapScript's getshape() or getvalue() methods, by setting the LAYER's PROCESSING 
parameter to "GETSHAPE_STYLE_ITEMS=all".  Therefore, the LAYER may contain: 

.. code-block:: mapfile

  LAYER
    ...
    PROCESSING "GETSHAPE_STYLE_ITEMS=all"
    ...
  END

The following label styles are supported:

FAQ / Common Problems
=====================

:Q: **What Does "OGR" Stand For?**

:A: Basically, OGR does not stand for anything. For a detailed explanation of how 
    OGR was named, see GDAL's FAQ at http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/FAQ.

:Q: **When using STYLEITEM AUTO, what should I have in my .sym symbols file?**

:A: When you use STYLEITEM AUTO, MapServer tries to match symbol names returned 
    by OGR to names in your symbol file. For a quick solution, try using the 
    following symbol file:

    http://www2.dmsolutions.ca/msapps/yk_demo/etc/symbols_mapinfo.sym

    The name of the symbols returned by OGR to MapServer depends on the file format. 
    In the case of MapInfo files, it will be:

    - For "old-style" symbols (default MapInfo 3.0 symbols numbered 32 to 67) the 
      symbol name will be 'mapinfo-sym-##' where '##' is the symbol number, 
      e.g. 'mapinfo-sym-32'. 

    - For "Font Symbols", the symbol name is also 'mapinfo-sym-##' where '##' is 
      the symbol number in the font. In this case, the name of the font itself is 
      ignored by MapServer. 

    - MapInfo also supports "custom symbols" (bitmap symbols)... I'm not sure what 
      you would get from OGR for this, but I'm pretty sure that MapServer doesn't 
      do anything useful with them. 

    The OGRINFO utility can be used to find out exactly which symbol names OGR will 
    return to MapServer. Look at the "Style" string in the ogrinfo output for each 
    shape that is read.
