Example 1.2

Static Map with Two Layers
--------------------------

.. image::  http://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms4w/apps/tutorial/htdocs/example1-2.map&layer=states_poly&layer=states_line&mode=map

As in the first example, this image was generated by linking the source of the
<img> tag to this URL: 
`<http://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms4w/apps/tutorial/htdocs/example1-2.map&layer=states_poly&layer=states_line&mode=map>`_. 
This is how most of the examples in this section work.

Anyway, you'll notice that the map here is the same as the first example. Yes, 
but the mapfile is different. Have a look.

This is what the mapfile looks like: 
:ref:`Example1-2.map <example1-2-map>`

MapFile Structure
#################

The mapfile structure, by objects, looks like this:

::

                   MAP
              LAYER-|-LAYER
            CLASS-|   |-CLASS
          STYLE-|       |-STYLE</pre>

Here we split the original layer into two layers. The first layer is still a 
polygon layer but the :ref:`STYLE object <style>` no longer has OUTLINECOLOR, 
such as:

.. code-block:: mapfile

	  LAYER
	    ...
	    TYPE         POLYGON
	    ...
	    CLASS
	      NAME       "States"
	      STYLE
	        COLOR    232 232 232
	      END
	    END
	  END

The second layer is similar to the first except that the TYPE is changed to 
LINE and the COLOR in the STYLE is changed to the same color as the OUTLINECOLOR 
in the first example. This produces the same image as the first one.

.. code-block:: mapfile

  	LAYER
  	  ...
  	  TYPE         LINE
  	  CLASS
  	    NAME       "State Boundary"
  	    STYLE
  	      COLOR    32 32 32
  	    END
  	  END
  	END



So, why do it this way?
#######################

If we continue to add layers on top of the states layer, the outline will most likely 
be covered up by these other layers.  To still see the state boundaries after 
we add these other layers, we have to separate the states boundary line layer 
from the states polygon layer and put it on top of the other other layers.  
There is order in how we define/add layers and you'll see it clearly as we 
proceed in this section.
