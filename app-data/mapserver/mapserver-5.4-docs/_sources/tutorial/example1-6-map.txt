	  # The projection object is typically used within the map and the layer

	  # becomes your output projection--MapServer will render your maps in this
	  # projection.  You also use the projection object within the layer object to 
	  # define your input projection.  Your layers can be in different 
	  # projections--MapServer will reproject them into your output projection.  
	  # If no projection is defined within the layer object, MapServer assumes 
	  # your input projection is the same as your output projection.  This is not

	  # in map.h in the MapServer source.  The default limit is set at 100.  You'd
	  # have to have a very specialized application to need more than 100 layers in

	  # In addition to vector data (shapefiles are vector data), MapServer supports

	  # formats is GeoTIFF, a TIFF image with geospatial headers.  MapServer also
	  # supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and other common formats.  Other raster formats
	  # supported by MapServer include ESRI Arc/Info grid, HDF and HDF-EOS, NetCDF, 
	  # Generic raster binaries, OGC Web Map Service (WMS) layers, etc.  Pretty much 
	  # any raster format you can think of is probably supported, thanks to the

	  # or GOODLE?).  More information on GDAL is available at http://www.gdal.org.
