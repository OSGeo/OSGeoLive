Adding a Raster Layer
---------------------

.. image:: http://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms4w/apps/tutorial/htdocs/example1-5.map&layer=states&layer=states_line&layer=states_label&layer=modis&mode=map

In addition to vector data support (point, lines, polygons, and annotations), 
MapServer can also display raster data. Through the use of GDAL library, MapServer 
can input and output multiple raster formats. Whereas in versions prior to 4.x raster 
input is limited to single layer, grayscale or indexed color images, recent MapServer 
versions support RGB and multispectral (multi-layer) images. This example shows how to 
select what layers to display when using multispectral data. 

.. note:: 

     There might be a noticeable performance hit when using RGB and multispectral images.

Because MapServer 5.x uses GD version 2.0.x library to generate output images, it 
supports RGB (24-bit or true color) output as well. So, along with 8-bit (indexed 
color or grayscale) PNG, you can now also use PNG24 (true color) for output. This 
example uses PNG24 as IMAGETYPE. 

.. note::

     As with RGB input, there might be a noticeable performance hit when using PNG24.

MapServer can actually use GDAL to generate output images as well, but that's another
topic. If you want to know more about it, look at the :ref:`OUTPUTFORMAT <outputformat>`
object in the mapfile reference.

MapFile Structure
#################

This is what the mapfile looks like: :ref:`Example1-5.map <example1-5-map>`

The mapfile structure, by objects, looks like this:

::

                                               MAP
               LAYER #1-------------LAYER #2----|----LAYER #3--------LAYER #4
            (states_poly)           (modis)       (states_line)   (states_label)
               |                                     |               |
  (land) CLASS-|-CLASS (water)                       |-CLASS         |-CLASS
             |   |                                     |                 |
       STYLE-|   |-STYLE                               |-STYLE     STYLE-|-LABEL


When you look at the mapfile, you'll see that the new LAYER object is added below
(after) the state POLYGON layer. Why? MapServer displays layers in reverse order:
last in, first out (LIFO). The first layer defined in the mapfile is drawn at
the bottom of the map.

So, if we have drawn the state POLYGON layer, it would be on the bottom. Since the
raster layer gets drawn on top of it, we won't see it. That's why the first layer
gets the STATUS value of OFF. The state LINE layer is defined below the raster
layer so it gets drawn on top (and you can see it). This is why we separated the
state LINE layer from the state POLYGON layer. Of course the labels get drawn
on top of everything.

MapServer can automatically turn layers on or off based on the status of other
layers (say you want the states polygon layer turned off when the raster layer
is turned on). This is done by using the REQUIRES parameter. Keep this in
mind as you might want to use it once you start creating your own MapServer
applications.

Parameters
##########

Let's have a look at the new parameters introduced in the mapfile:

**IMAGETYPE**
  This is not new but the value "PNG24" is. PNG24 is the 24-bit or true-color
  version of the PNG format. Instead of being limited to 256 color combinations
  for our output image, MapServer now have millions. By the way, try changing
  this value back to PNG. Notice the time it takes to generate the image using
  either formats. In choosing between true color and indexed color, take into
  account the time it takes to generate the image.

**SYMBOLSET**
  Points to the path of the symbol definition file. The symbols in this file
  are referenced by the SYMBOL parameter in the :ref:`CLASS <class>` object.
  It's not really needed at this point but I thought I'd throw this here now.
  Please refer to the :ref:`Cartographic Symbol Reference <sym_construction>`
  for further information.

**DATA raster/mod09a12003161_ugl_ll_8bit.tif**

  In the newly added LAYER object, the DATA parameter points to a GeoTIFF image.
  Like vector datasets, MapServer supports multiple raster file formats. This
  support is accomplished through use of the GDAL library. For more information
  on the different raster formats supported by MapServer and for general
  discussion on the use of rasters in MapServer, please read the
  :ref:`Raster Data Reference <raster>`.

**TYPE RASTER**
  When using raster data (images) we use the value RASTER for the parameter
  TYPE, as opposed to the POLYGON, LINE, and POINT values for vector data and
  ANNOTATION for label IDs.

**PROCESSING "BANDS=1,2,3"**
  This LAYER object parameter was added in MapServer 4.x. The
  :ref:<PROCESSING> keyword has many values but in this case we are using it to
  select which bands in a multispectral image to display. The values here are
  strings that will be passed to the GDAL library.

**OFFSITE**
  This parameter tells MapServer what pixel values to render as background
  (or ignore). You can get the pixel values using image processing or image
  manipulation programs (i.e. Imagine, Photoshop, Gimp).

RGB vs Indexed Color Image
##########################

To compare map creation speed when using RGB image as opposed to indexed color
image, replace the following lines in the mapfile:

.. code-block:: mapfile

  DATA "raster/mod09a12003161_ugl_ll_8bit.tif"
  STATUS DEFAULT
  TYPE RASTER
  PROCESSING "BANDS=1,2,3"
  OFFSITE 71 74 65

with these:

.. code-block:: mapfile


  DATA "raster/mod09a12003161_ugl_ll_idxa.tif"
  STATUS DEFAULT
  TYPE RASTER
  OFFSITE 70 74 66

Also, try changing the IMAGETYPE from PNG24 to PNG.
