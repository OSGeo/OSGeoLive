The MapFile
###########

Here's the mapfile: :ref:`Example1-8.map <example1-8-map>`

OUTPUTFORMAT Object
*******************
Our mapfile now contains a new object, OUTPUTFORMAT. This object is defined 
within the MAP object and is used in conjunction with the IMAGETYPE keyword. 
Depending on the libraries you compiled with MapServer, you can have several
output format choices--the GD library provides PNG (8- and 24-bit), GIF, JPEG,
and WBMP; the GDAL library, a source for many of MapServer's input formats, can
also provide output to PNG, JPEG, TIFF/GeoTIFF, and other raster formats; the 
PDFLib library provides PDF output; and the MING library provides Flash output. 
Have a look at the OUTPUTFORMAT object and experiment by changing the IMAGETYPE 
keyword on you mapfile. The NAME of your OUTPUT format should be used as your 
IMAGETYPE value ex: IMAGETYPE png or IMAGETYPE png24).

Please consult the :ref:`OUTPUTFORMAT object reference <outputformat>`.
