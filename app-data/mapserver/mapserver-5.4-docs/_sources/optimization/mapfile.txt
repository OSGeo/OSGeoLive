Introduction
------------

The contents of a Map File are used by MapServer for configuration, data
access, projection, and more. Because the Map File is parsed every time a map
image is requested, it is important to think about what you include in the
file in order to optimize performance. The optimal Map File is one that
doesn't include or reference anything that isn't needed.

1. Projections
==============

There are two ways to define projections in a Map File. You can either use
inline projection parameters or specify an EPSG code for that projection. If
you use the :term:`EPSG` code method, :term:`Proj.4` looks up the projection
parameters in the Proj4 database using the EPSG code as an ID. This database
lookup takes significantly more resources than when the projection parameters
are defined inline. This lookup takes place for each projection definition
using EPSG codes in a Map File.

**Projection defined using inline projection parameters**

.. code-block:: mapfile

    PROJECTION
      "proj=utm"
      "ellps=GRS80"
      "datum=NAD83"
      "zone=15"
      "units=m"
      "north"
      "no_defs"
    END
    
**Projection defined using EPSG Code**

.. code-block:: mapfile

    PROJECTION
       "init=epsg:26915"
    END

**Optimization Suggestions**

- Use inline projection parameter definitions in place of EPSG codes.

- If you want to use EPSG codes, remove all unneeded projection definition
  records from the Proj.4 :term:`EPSG` database.


2. Layers
==============

For every layer in a Map File that has a status of ON or DEFAULT, MapServer
will load that layer and prepare it for display, even if that layer never gets
displayed.

**Optimization Suggestions**

- Build lean Map Files, only include layers that you plan to use.  

- Turn off unnecessary layers; the more layers MapServer is displaying, the
  more time it takes. Have your opening map view show only the minimum
  necessary to orient the user, and allow them to turn on additional layers as
  needed. This is particularly true of remote WMS or very large rasters.

- Related to turning off layers, is turning them on but using MINSCALEDENOM
  and MAXSCALEDENOM to determine at what zoomlevels the layer is available. If
  a map's display is outside of the layer's MINSCALEDENOM and MAXSCALEDENOM
  range, then MapServer can skip processing that layer. It also makes for a
  really cool effect, that the national boundaries magically change to state
  boundaries.

- If you have a complex application, consider using multiple simple and
  specific Map Files in place of one large 'do everything' Map File.

- In a similar vein, each class also supports MINSCALEDENOM and MAXSCALEDENOM.
  If your dataset has data that are relevant at different zoomlevels, then you
  may find this a very handy trick. For example, give a MINSCALEDENOM of
  1:1000000, county roads a MINSCALEDENOM of 1:100000, and streets a
  MAXSCALEDENOM of 1:50000. You get the cool effect of new data magically
  appearing, but you don't have MapServer trying to draw the nation's roads
  when the entire nation is in view!

- Classes are processed in order, and a feature is assigned to the first class
  that matches. So try placing the most commonly-used classes at the top of
  the class list, so MapServer doesn't have to try as many classes before
  finding a match. For example, if you wanted to highlight the single state of
  Wyoming, you would probably do this:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    CLASS
       EXPRESSION ('[NAME]' eq 'WY'])
       STYLE
         COLOR 255 0 0
       END
    END
    CLASS
       STYLE
       COLOR 128 128 128
       END
    END

But it would be a lot more efficient to do this, since 98% of cases will be
matched on the first try:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   CLASS
     EXPRESSION ('[NAME]' ne 'WY'])
     STYLE
       COLOR 128 128 128
     END
   END
   CLASS
     STYLE
       COLOR 255 0 0
     END
   END

- Use :ref:`tile indexes <tileindex>` instead of multiple layers.

3. Symbols
==============

When the Map File is loaded, each raster symbol listed in the symbols file is
located on the filesystem and loaded.

**Optimization Suggestions**

- Only include raster symbols in your symbols file if you know that they will
  be used by your application.

4. Fonts
==============

To load a font, MapServer opens up the fonts.list :ref:`fontset` file which
contains an alias for the font and the path for that font file. If you have a
fonts.list file with a long list of fonts, it will take more time for
MapServer to locate and load the font that you need.

**Optimization Suggestions**

- Limit the entries in fonts.list to fonts that you actually use.
