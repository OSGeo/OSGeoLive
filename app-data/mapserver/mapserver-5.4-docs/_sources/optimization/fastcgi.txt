=============================================================================
 Introduction
=============================================================================

FastCGI is a protocol for keeping cgi-bin style web applications running as a 
daemon to take advantage of preserving memory caches, and amortizing other 
high startup costs (like heavy database connections) over many requests.

=============================================================================
 Obtaining the necessary software
=============================================================================

1.  There are three pieces to the MapServer FastCGI puzzle.  First, you need 
    the actual FastCGI library.  This can be downloaded from 
    `http://www.fastcgi.com/ <http://www.fastcgi.com/>`__.  This library does 
    the usual *configure, make, make install* dance.  One added complication 
    is that it installs by default in /usr/local, and you might give the 
    *configure* command a --prefix=/usr to put it in a location that is 
    already visible to ldconfig.

2.  Assuming you are running `Apache <http://httpd.apache.org>`__, the next 
    piece you need is mod_fcgi.  Mod_fcgi depends on the version of Apache 
    you are running, so make sure to download the correct fork 
    (Apache 1.3 vs. Apache 2).

3.  The third and final piece is to compile MapServer with FastCGI support. 
    This is pretty straightforward, and all you need to do is tell 
    *configure* where the FastCGI library is installed.  If you changed 
    the prefix variable as described above, this would be: 

::

  ./configure [other options] --with-fastcgi=/usr

With those pieces in place, the MapServer CGI (mapserv) should now be 
FastCGI-enabled.  You can verify this by testing it on with the command line:

::

  [hobu@kenyon mapserver-4.4.2]# ./mapserv -v
  MapServer version 4.4.2 OUTPUT=GIF OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=JPEG OUTPUT=WBMP 
  SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=FREETYPE SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER SUPPORTS=WMS_CLIENT 
  SUPPORTS=WFS_SERVER SUPPORTS=WFS_CLIENT SUPPORTS=FASTCGI INPUT=EPPL7 
  INPUT=SDE INPUT=ORACLESPATIAL INPUT=OGR INPUT=GDAL 
  INPUT=SHAPEFILE DEBUG=MSDEBUG

=============================================================================
 Configuration
=============================================================================

1.  Modify http.conf to load the FastCGI module.

    ::
      
      LoadModule fastcgi_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_fastcgi.so

2.  Add an Apache handler for FastCGI applications.

    ::
    
      AddHandler fastcgi-script fcgi

3.  Set FastCGI processing information

    ::
    
      FastCgiConfig -initial-env PROJ_LIB=/usr/local/share/proj 
      -initial-env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/pgsql/lib:/usr3/pkg3/oracle9/lib 
      -appConnTimeout 60 -idle-timeout 60 -init-start-delay 1 
      -minProcesses 2 -maxClassProcesses 20 -startDelay 5

4.  In your mapfile, set a PROCESSING directive to tell FastCGI to cache 
    the connections and layer information on all layers for which connection 
    caching is desired - ie. all slow layers.

    .. code-block:: mapfile
       
       PROCESSING "CLOSE_CONNECTION=DEFER"


=============================================================================
 Common Problems
=============================================================================
File permissions
-------------------
Fedora Core 3 doesn't allow FastCGI to write to the process logs (when you 
use RedHat's Apache 2 rather than your own).  This is described `here 
<http://www.fastcgi.com/archives/fastcgi-developers/2005-March/003638.html>`__.

Also, FastCGI needs to write its socket information somewhere.  This 
can be directed with the *FastCgiIpcDir* directive.

 FastCGI on Win32
=============================================================================

MS4W Users
----------

`MS4W (MapServer for Windows)`_ >= version 2.2.2 contains MapServer compiled
with FastCGI support. MS4W version >= 2.2.8 also contains the required Apache
module (mod_fcgid), and users must follow the `README instructions`_ to setup
FastCGI with their application.

.. _README instructions: http://www.maptools.org/ms4w/index.phtml?page=README_INSTALL.html#f-fastcgi


Building fcgi-2.4.0
-------------------

I used libfcgi-2.4.0 for use with Apache2 from http://www.fastcgi.com.

Binary IO Patch
---------------

It is critical that stdio be in binary mode when PNG and other binary images
are written to it. To accomplish this for stdio handled through the FastCGI
library, I had to do the following hack to libfcgi/fcgi_stdio.c within the
fcgi-2.4.0 distribution.

In FCGI_Accept() made he following change

.. code-block:: c

      if(isCGI) {
        FCGI_stdin->stdio_stream = stdin;
        FCGI_stdin->fcgx_stream = NULL;
        FCGI_stdout->stdio_stream = stdout;
        FCGI_stdout->fcgx_stream = NULL;
        FCGI_stderr->stdio_stream = stderr;
        FCGI_stderr->fcgx_stream = NULL;

        /* FrankWarmerdam: added so that returning PNG and other binary data
           will still work */
      #ifdef _WIN32
        _setmode( _fileno(stdout), _O_BINARY);
        _setmode( _fileno(stdin), _O_BINARY);
      #endif

      } else {

Also, add the following just before the FCGI_Accept() function

.. code-block:: c

    #ifdef _WIN32
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <io.h>
    #endif

I'm sure there is a better way of accomplishing this. If you know how, please
let me know!

Building libfcgi
----------------

The makefile.nt should be fine. Just ensure you have run VCVARS32.BAT (as is
needed for building MapServer) and then issue the command::

  nmake /f makefile.nt 

Then the .lib and .dll will be in libfcgi/Debug?. Make sure you copy the DLL
somewhere appropriate (such as your cgi-bin directory).

Other Issues
------------

1) FastCGI's receive a very limited environment on win32, seemingly even more
restricted than normal cgi's started by apache. Make sure that all DLLs
required are either in the fastcgi directory or in windows\system32. Any
missing DLLs will result in very cryptic errors in the error_log, including
stuff about Overlapping read requests failing or something like that.

2) Make sure you use a libfcgi.dll built against the same runtime library as
your mapserv.exe (and possibly libmap_fcgi.dll) or you will suffer a world of
pain! Different runtime libraries have different "environ" variables (as well
as their own stdio and heaps). You can check that everything is using
MSVCRT.DLL (or all using MSVCRTD.DLL) using the MS SDK Dependency Walker.
