Introduction
============

The purpose of this document is to be a step by step explanation of the 
:ref:`php` with practical examples for each of 
them.  It is assumed a basic knowledge of :ref:`map` and MapServer, and 
familiarity with the `PHP (scripting)`_ and `HTML (markup)`_ languages .
This document was originally created for MapServer v4.0, but the examples still
apply to more recent versions.

**Let's Begin...**

Hello, kind reader. I am Tut, thank you for downloading me. I am sorry, but I am 
just a technical manual so I cannot answer any questions. The maintainer, a 
handsome, very nice and lazy guy according to what I saw from the other side of 
the screen, maybe will be able to answer your question(s). I am currently here to 
tell you about MapScript in its PHP incarnation. At my current age, I will be more 
useful to beginners than advanced users, even though I hope that some day I will 
be sufficiently old to be useful to advanced MapScript programmers.

Let's hope I live long enough... sigh.

But enough with my personal problems, let myself begin. My duty is to familiarize 
you with MapScript, and in particular with PHP MapScript. When I end, you are 
expected to understand what MapScript is, and to be able to write applications to 
display and navigate that is, zooming and panning over shapefiles via a web browser.

What follows are the questions you must answer affirmatively before accompanying 
me through the rest of this journey (I apologize for my maintainer's lack of 
literary taste).

Do you have running somewhere...
--------------------------------

- a web server capable of running PHP as a CGI (Apache will do)?

- the PHP language configured as a CGI, version 4.1.2 or higher? I recommend 4.3 onwards.

- PHP MapScript, version 4.0 or later? :ref:`php_install`

Can you...
----------

- code PHP or are willing to `learn how to`_?

- write and understand `HTML`_ documents? (Note that Javascript is a plus)

- tell somebody what on earth is a `shapefile`_ [or a `PostGIS`_ table]?

Outline of this Document
------------------------

- A general overview of MapScript, in a language independent way

- A trivial example

- A simple example

- Conclusion

You can also go to each part directly through my table of contents located at 
the top, if you wish to skip some sections.

MapScript overview
==================

Ok, now I'm at last arriving at a point I will enjoy. This overview intends to 
clear some common misconceptions beginners encounter when first facing MapScript 
and to give a general overview about MapScript's internals. For now, just look 
at the following diagram (I apologize again for the maintainer's lack of graphic 
design taste).

.. image:: ../../images/phpmapscript-byexample-map.png

It all starts as everything on the Web. A browser requests a certain URL through 
HTTP. The request arrives at the web server, which, in turn, delivers a file or 
executes a program and then delivers its output back to the browser. Yes, I know 
you knew that, but I have been told to be as complete as possible, and I will 
try to.

In MapScript's case, the server executes a certain script, which contains standard 
language functionality, that is, the same functionality you would have in that 
language without MapScript, plus access to almost all of the MapServer C API, the 
level of completeness of MapServer API support varies a bit with the language you 
choose, but I think it is my duty to tell you almost every available flavor of 
MapScript is usable. This API, exposed now in your scripting language through the 
MapScript module, allows you to do many GIS-like operations on spatial data, 
including read-write access to shapefiles, reprojection of data, and many others. 
For more information on the API, click over the link above. For other flavors, 
you can check their own documentation, you will see there is not much difference.

The CGI version of MapServer is not required to run MapScript applications, just as 
you don't need a particular MapScript module to run the CGI. The CGI version has 
many features out-of-the-box, MapScript is just an API, so with MapScript you must 
start from scratch or with some of the examples available. Think of the CGI as of a 
MapScript application written directly in C, with direct access to the MapServer C 
API. Sometimes the out-of-the-box functionality has some limits which can be surpassed 
by MapScript, but not embedded within the CGI. In other words, the CGI is not 
scriptable, but you can program all the CGI and more with MapScript. This may seem a 
strange thing to clarify, but is a common misconception, just check the `list archives`_ 
if you are not inclined to believe me.

As with MapServer itself, MapScript can be configured using only map files, but, unlike 
the CGI, also includes the possibility of dynamically create maps or modify existing 
ones and to (and here is the key to the flexibility that MapScript has) mix this 
information with other sources of non GIS data, such as user input, non spatial and 
spatial databases, text files, etc. and that you can use every single module your 
language provides. The power of this approach is tremendous, and the most restrictive 
limit is your imagination. As always, flexibility comes with a price, performance. 
It's generally slower to use a scripting language instead of C, but nowadays this 
shouldn't be a big worry. And you can still program directly in C (there are not much 
documents about how to do it, though you might want to check the `mapserver-dev list`_) 
if you would like to.

The input and output formats MapScript can handle are exactly the same as the ones 
configured when you build MapServer/MapScript. But one of the most important things 
to remember is that, basically, you feed geographic data and relevant user input (for 
instance clicks over the map image) to MapScript and as a result get one or more 
file(s), typically standard image files such as a PNG or JPEG. So you can apply anything 
you've seen in any server side scripted web application, DHTML, Java applets, CSS, 
HTML templates, sessions, you name it.

Our first application
=====================

In this first example, I will tell you how to display a shapefile on a web page using 
a map file.

The Map File
------------

Here's the map file:

::

        NAME "Europe in purple"
        SIZE 400 400
        STATUS ON
        SYMBOLSET "/var/www/html/maps/symbols/symbols.sym"
        EXTENT -5696501 1923039 5696501 11022882
        UNITS METERS
        SHAPEPATH "/var/www/html/maps/data"
            
        WEB
            IMAGEPATH "/var/www/html/maps/tmp/"
            IMAGEURL "/tmp/"
        END
        
        LAYER
            NAME "Europe"
            TYPE POLYGON
            STATUS ON
            DATA "europe"
            CLASS
                STYLE
                    COLOR 110 50 100
                    OUTLINECOLOR 200 200 200
                    SYMBOL 0
                END
            END
        END
        
        END
        

Here I have shown a map with a single layer, where the europe.shp, europe.shx and 
europe.dbf files must be located in the subdirectory called data. The symbols are 
located in the symbols subdirectory. All this locations are relative from the place 
the map file is, but better safe than sorry, I guess. The web section is used to 
define where will the images be saved and in what URL will they be available.

Displaying the map with MapScript
---------------------------------

To display a map the following MapScript objects and methods will be used:

- MapObj object
- imageObj object

MapObj methods:

- The constructor method: MapObj ms_newMapObj(string map_file_name[,string new_map_path])
- The draw method: imageObj draw()

imageObj methods:

- The saveWebImage method: string saveWebImage()

The code looks like this:

::

        1 <?php
        
        2 dl('php_mapscript.so'); 
        
        3 $map_path="/var/www/html/ms/map_files/";
                
        4 $map = ms_newMapObj($map_path."europe.map");
        5 $image=$map->draw();
        6 $image_url=$image->saveWebImage();
        
        7 ?>
        
        8  <HTML>
        9   <HEAD>
        10      <TITLE>Example 1: Displaying a map</TITLE>
        11  </HEAD>
        12  <BODY>
        13      <IMG SRC=<?php echo $image_url; ?> >
        14  </BODY>
        15 </HTML>
        

The code I will present through the rest of this document will follow the 
following rule:

- Every non empty line is numbered

This code will render an image corresponding to the shapefile europe and display 
it on a HTML page.

Code Explanation
----------------

- In line 2 it is loaded the MapScript extension (you may not need it if your 
  php.ini file is configured to automatically load it).
- Line 3 declares a variable that holds the absolute path for the mapfile.
- Line 4 creates an instance of the MapObj object using the constructor. As you 
  can see, the constructor receives the location of the map file as its only 
  required parameter, and the map file received the europe.map name.
- Afterwards the draw method of the map object is called to render the image 
  defined by the map file (line 5). The result (an imageObj) is saved in the 
  $image variable.
- Line 6 calls the saveWebImage method to generate the image file, it returns a 
  string which represents the URL as defined in the mapfile (in this case, 
  /tmp/filename.png).
- The rest of the lines are pure HTML, except line 13, that defines the source 
  URL of the image will be the value stored in $image_url.

You should test the application on your system, to check that it really works 
and to solve the problems that may arise on your particular configuration before 
moving on to the more complex examples.

Output
------

The output (using the europe shapefile) should look like this:

.. image:: ../../images/phpmapscript-byexample-map.png

Zooming and Panning
-------------------

Now I will tell you how to add zoom and pan capabilities to the code.

Here goes the list of new methods and objects called.

New Objects:

- pointObj
- rectObj 

New Methods and Members called:

- The zoompoint method of the map object: void zoompoint(int nZoomFactor, 
  pointObj oPixelPos, int nImageWidth, int nImageHeight, rectObj oGeorefExt).
- The setextent method of the map object: $map->setextent(double minx, 
  double miny, double maxx, double maxy);.
- The extent, width and height members of the map object.
- The constructors of RectObj and PointObj: $point = ms_newPointObj(); 
  $rect = ms_newRectObj();
- The setXY method of the point object: $point->setXY(double x_coord, 
  double y_coord);
- The setextent method of the rectangle object: $rect->setextent(double minx, 
  double miny, double maxx, double maxy);

The .map file remains the same as the one presented in the previous example.

PHP/MapScript Code
------------------

Here I present the new code.

::

        1 <?php
        
        2 dl('php_mapscript.so');
        
        3 // Default values and configuration
        
        4 $val_zsize=3;
        5 $check_pan="CHECKED";
        6 $map_path="/var/www/html/ms/map_files/";
        7 $map_file="europe.map";
        
        8 $map = ms_newMapObj($map_path.$map_file);
        
        
        9 if ( isset($_POST["mapa_x"]) && isset($_POST["mapa_y"])
        10      && !isset($_POST["full"]) ) {
        
        11      $extent_to_set = explode(" ",$_POST["extent"]); 
        
        12      $map->setextent($extent_to_set[0],$extent_to_set[1],
        13                      $extent_to_set[2],$extent_to_set[3]);
        
        14      $my_point = ms_newpointObj();
        15      $my_point->setXY($_POST["mapa_x"],$_POST["mapa_y"]);
        
        16      $my_extent = ms_newrectObj();
        
        17      $my_extent->setextent($extent_to_set[0],$extent_to_set[1],
        18                              $extent_to_set[2],$extent_to_set[3]);
        
        19      $zoom_factor = $_POST["zoom"]*$_POST["zsize"];
        20      if ($zoom_factor == 0) {
        21              $zoom_factor = 1;
        22              $check_pan = "CHECKED";
        23              $check_zout = "";
        24              $check_zin = "";
        25      } else if ($zoom_factor < 0) {
        26              $check_pan = "";
        27              $check_zout = "CHECKED";
        28              $check_zin = "";
        29      } else {
        30              $check_pan = "";
        31              $check_zout = "";
        32              $check_zin = "CHECKED";
        33      }
        
        34      $val_zsize = abs($zoom_factor);
        
        35      $map->zoompoint($zoom_factor,$my_point,$map->width,$map->height,
        36                      $my_extent);
        
        37 }
        
        
        38 $image=$map->draw();
        39 $image_url=$image->saveWebImage();
        
        40 $extent_to_html = $map->extent->minx." ".$map->extent->miny." "
        41              .$map->extent->maxx." ".$map->extent->maxy;

This code will zoom out, zoom in, pan, and restore to full extent the image 
displayed in the previous example.

It looks much more complicated than it really is, much of the lines are the 
HTML code, and much of the remaining PHP code is just to deal with the forms 
and such.

You should try it and look at how it works first.  Try it in your own server 
by copying and pasting the code.

Now it's time for you to play with it a little and look at the source in your 
browser to check how it changes.

Done?, now let's start the explanation with the HTML part.

Code Explanation - HTML
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Line 49 declares a form, and line 53 declares the image generated by MapScript 
to be part of that form, so when you click on it, the X and Y coordinates of the 
click (in pixels) will be sent along with the other data for the PHP code to 
process.

If you are familiar with HTML and PHP, the rest of the HTML code should be 
straightforward for you to understand with the exception of line 98, that will 
be explained in due time.

Code Explanation - PHP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now look at the PHP code, it's almost the same code used in example 1, with the 
addition of lines 9 to 37. What do these lines do?

Line 9 checks the relevant variables from the form have been setted. 'mapa_x' and 
'mapa_y' represent the X and Y coordinates of the click over the image, and 'full' 
represents the click on the 'Full Extent' button.

The first time the page is displayed the code between the if statement doesn't get 
executed, but the rest of the code does. Lines 40 and 41 set the '$extent_to_html' 
variable with the values of the extent defined in the map file separated by spaces; 
that value will be put in the HTML variable 'extent' in line 98.

Now look at line 11 and 12. We are inside the if statement, that means the form has 
been submitted at least once. We grab the extent stored in the previous execution 
(the 'extent' HTML variable) of the code and set the extent of the map to be that 
last extent. This allows to zoom or pan with respect of the previous extent, not 
the extent that is set in the map file.

From that last paragraph you can deduce that all the default values are set in the 
map file, and anything that you change through MapScript and would like to remain 
in your code, must be stored somehow. In this case it is done through hidden variables 
in a form. For more advanced applications you could use session variables or a database.

Now you should be able to see why the 'Full Extent' button works. If you check 
line 10, it says that if you haven't pressed the button, skip the code in the if 
statement, so the extent is reset to the value that the map file has. You should 
also see that it isn't necessarily a full extent (in case the extent in the map 
file is not full extent).

Lines 14 and 15 declare a new point object and initialize it with the values the 
user clicked on. You should not forget that those values are in pixels, not in 
georeferenced coordinates.

Lines 16 through 18 create a new rectangle object and set it with the extent of 
the previous image, just like it is done on line 12. In fact this would work too: 
$my_extent = $map->extent;.

To do all the zooming and panning, the zoompoint function in called on line 35, 
but first the arguments it receives must be prepared. You can determine the point 
the user clicked on, and the extent of the image ($my_point and $my_extent, 
respectively), but now you have to determine the zoom factor. That's what lines 
19 to 33 do. If you wondered why the values of the radio buttons where 0, -1, 
and 1 for pan, zoom in and zoom out, now you will know the reason.

A zoom factor of 1 tells zoompoint that the operation is pan, a negative value 
indicates zoom out and a positive value indicates zoom in. So, by means of 
multiplying the value received for the radio buttons (HTML variable 'zoom') by 
the size of the zoom the user entered the zoom factor is calculated. If that 
value is 0, that means the user selected the pan operation, so '$zoom_factor' 
is set to 1, otherwise the result of the multiplication is the zoom factor zoompoint 
needs to receive. The other lines are to preserve the button the user clicked on 
the next time. Line 34 tries to preserve the value of the zoom size the user 
entered (It doesn't do that all the time, when and why that line fails? That's 
for you to find out).

And finally, line 34 calls the zoompoint method with the zoom factor obtained, 
the point built from the pixel coordinates (I insist on that issue because zoompoint 
is almost the only method that receives the coordinates in pixels, for the other 
methods you must convert pixels to georeferenced coordinates on your own), the 
height and width of the image, and the extent.

After calling zoompoint, the extent of the image is changed accordingly to the 
operation performed (or, better put, the zoom factor). So then the image is 
drawn and the current extent saved (after the zooming) for use in the next 
iteration.

Conclusions
===========

Well, it's time for me to go recharge my batteries. So I will use this last
energy to share some final words. The examples I have managed to present here
are very basic but you should now be able to devise ways to improve them and
suit things to your needs. Keep in mind that you can preprocess, store, read,
write data from any source you can usually read through PHP, plus all the
sources MapServer can handle for GIS data. You can even process some GIS data
with PHP only if the need would arise (SQL sources are a good example of
this). You can also do hybrid approaches where some script prepares data which
is then shown through the CGI interface to MapServer, or create data on the
fly based on input from a GPS, etc, etc. The possibilities are just too many
to enumerate completely. As I already said your imagination is the limit. The
next version of this document will include examples that include more than one
layer, with different datasources (not just shapefiles) and creation of
dynamic layers and classes. If you have a better idea or would like to see
some other thing here first, please drop a note to my maintainer.

In the meantime, if you need bigger examples you can refer to the `GMap demo`_
(you can download the source `here`_ or as an `MS4W packaged application`_),
or the `MapTools site`_ (MapLab, Chameleon). Goodbye, and thanks for reading
this far.
