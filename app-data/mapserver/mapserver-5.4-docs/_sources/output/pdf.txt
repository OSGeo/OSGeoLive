Introduction
============

PDF output support was added to MapServer 3.7.  Previous versions of MapServer 
had support for pdf output using a utility program (shp2pdf) to output a pdf file 
given a MapServer mapfile.

The difference in this new version is that the output to PDF can now be directly 
specified in the mapfile using the :ref:`IMAGETYPE <imagetype>` or the :ref:`OUTPUTFORMAT` parameters in the 
mapfile.  Additionally, raster layers are now supported for pdf output.

What is currently supported and not supported
=============================================
 
1. Vector Layers

    * Layer Point: supported
    * Layer Line: supported
    * Layer Polygon: supported
    * Layer Circle : not supported
    * Layer Annotation: supported

.. note::

    Note: Dashed lines are supported with PDFlib version 6 or greater.

.. note::

    Polygons filled with symbols are not supported.
    
2. Raster Layers

     Raster layers are supported. Note that at this point all raster layers are 
     transformed to jpeg format before being written to the PDF file. 

3. WMS Layers

     Not yet supported

4. Surround components

     Legend, scalebar are not supported.
     
5. Fonts

     Standard PostScript fonts are supported.  For use of other fonts (such
     as truetype), see the pdflib documentation for use of UPR description
     files (some notes on it are `here`_).

Implementing PDF Output
=======================

Note that the following instructions were developed for MapServer 3.7 and pdflib 
4.0.3, but the general steps should be similar for recent versions of both.

Build the PDF Library
---------------------

In order to have access to the PDF support in MapServer, you should download and 
build the PDF library from http://www.pdflib.com/products/pdflib/.  Please follow the 
instructions on the PDFLib site to build on your specific platforms.

Here are some quick notes on how to build on windows:

- download and extract the source code from http://www.pdflib.com/products/pdflib/

- open the project PDFlib.dsw in MS Visual C++

- build the project pdflib_dll

- after a sucessful build, you should have a pdflib.lib and pdblib.dll under the 
  pdflib directory

- copy the pdflib.dll under your system directory (ex : c:/winnt/system32)

- the pdflib.lib will be used while building mapserver with the PDF support

Build MapServer with PDF support
--------------------------------
 
**Windows platform**
 
Edit the makefile.vc and uncomment the following lines (make sure that the paths 
are adapted to your installation):

::

  PDF_LIB=../pdflib-4.0.3/pdflib/pdflib.lib

  PDF_INC=-I../pdflib-4.0.3/pdflib

  PDF=-DUSE_PDF

See the :ref:`Windows Compilation <win32>` document for general MapServer compile instructions.

**Unix platforms**
 
Add *with-pdf* to your configure command line before compiling.

See the :ref:`Unix Compilation <unix>` document for general MapServer compile instructions.

Mapfile definition
------------------
 
The IMAGETYPE parameter in the :ref:`mapfile` should be set to pdf in order to output 
to PDF:  

::

  NAME pdf-test
  STATUS ON
  ...
  IMAGETYPE pdf
  ..
  
  WEB
    ...
  END 
  
  LAYER
    ...
  END
  
  END
  
You can also specify the output using the :ref:`OUTPUTFORMAT` tag (this tag was introduced 
in mapserver 3.7) :

::

   OUTPUTFORMAT
     NAME pdf
     MIMETYPE "application/x-pdf"
     DRIVER pdf
     FORMATOPTION "OUTPUT_TYPE=RASTER" ##not mandatory
   END

If the OUTPUT_TYPE=RASTER all the layers will be rendered as rasters. Note that 
when WMS layers are included in the mapfile, this option should be set since 
there is a problem with transparency and wms layers.  See the :ref:`OUTPUTFORMAT` object
in the :ref:`mapfile` reference for parameter explanations.

Testing
-------

The easiest way to test your pdf output mapfile is with the MapServer 
:ref:`shp2img utility <shp2img>`.  Windows users can find this utility in `MS4W`_, as well as
`FWTools`_.

You simply pass a mapfile to the executable and a name for the output pdf, 
and a pdf file is generated:

::

   shp2img -m gmap_pdf.map -o test.pdf
   
Possible Errors
---------------

::

  PDFlib I/O error: Resource configuration file 'pdflib.upr' not found
  
This is related to fonts.  If you remove the LABEL object from your mapfile
you will see this error go away.  The pdf error is described `here`_.  Basically, 
until this issue is 'fixed', if you want to use a font other than the included 
standard PostScript fonts in pdf output (such as truetype fonts), consult the 
PDFlib documentation.

PHP/MapScript and PDF Output
============================

MapServer can render to PDF directly, another option is to render to a PNG and 
insert that into a PDF document. This is not the only way to create a PDF document
of course. You will need to have support for `PDFLib`_ compiled into your PHP install.

This example shows the key parts of the process, you will need to furnish parts 
of the script yourself (depending on your app) and repeat the process for each map 
element that you want to include. 

Refer to the :ref:`PHP/MapScript Reference <php>` wherever necessary.

How does it work?
-----------------

In brief, we will pass parameters required to render a map to a PHP script that will:

- create a PDF document
- render a PNG view at a suitably higher resolution
- insert the PNG
- buffer it and send it to the user

Create the PDF document
-----------------------

Here is an example similiar to the one given on the `PHP website`_ to create a new 
PDF document: 

::

    $my_pdf = pdf_new();
    ...

Get this stage and section 4.5 working before you try inserting MapServer elements. 

Render PNG views at a suitable resolution
--------------------------------------------

Work back from the assumption that you will need no more than 300 dpi on your 
page for your map to look presentable. For an A4 map, I am using 150 dpi for an 
8' x 8' main map, which is 1200 x 1200 pixels.

::

    $map->set(width,1200);
    $map->set(height,1200);

Of course, our map will not be very useful unless it is zoomed in to the extent 
our user requested, and the layers they selected are switched on. Maintain arrays 
in your application that record:

::

  - The current extent (say $ext[])
  - Layer status (say $layer[])

Open your map file and pass these back through to set the map file into the state 
the user is expecting, something like:

::

    $map->setextent($ext[0], $ext[1], $ext[2], $ext[3]);

    while($layer[]) {
        $layer=$map->getLayer($n);
        if($layer[$n]==1) {
            $layer->set(status,1);
        } else {
            $layer->set(status,0);
        }
    }

Now you will need to save a rendered view to a PNG file.

::

    $img = $map->draw();
    $url = $img->saveWebImage(MS_PNG, 0, 0, 0);

Use the same method for all your map elements, such as drawReferenceMap?(), 
drawScaleBar?() and drawLegend(). 

Insert the PNG elements into your PDF document
-------------------------------------------------

This is really easy, use the pdf_open_image_file() function to import the map 
elements into your PDF document:

::

    $element = pdf_open_image_file($my_pdf, "png", "$webroot/$url");
    pdf_place_image($my_pdf, $element, $xpos, $ypos);
    pdf_close_image($my_pdf, $element);

Repeat as needed for any map elements you created. 

Buffer the PDF and send it to the user
--------------------------------------

Assuming we have been creating the document $my_pdf, when we are done, we merely 
buffer it and send it to the user using echo():

::

    <?php
    
    ....
    pdf_close($my_pdf);

    $data = pdf_get_buffer($my_pdf);

    header('Content-type: application/pdf');
    header('Content-disposition: inline; filename=my_pdf.pdf');
    header('Content-length: ' . strlen($data) );

    echo $data;

    ?>

Gotcha: remember that you cannot send headers if you have at any stage outputed 
text to the browser. 

Additional stuff to try
--------------------------
Rendering everything as PNG can look ugly, so I step through the key and extract 
labels so I can render them using PDF's text functions.

This can be done for other map element, such as map titles, layer descriptions, 
or anything else that can be read from the mapfile.
