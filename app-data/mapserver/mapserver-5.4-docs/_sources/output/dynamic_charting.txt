Starting with version 5.0, MapServer included the ability to automatically draw 
pie or bar graphs whose values are taken and adjusted from attributes of a 
datasource. 

This document assumes that you are already familiar with MapServer application 
development and especially setting up :ref:`mapfile` s. You 
can also check out the :ref:`Vector Data Access Guide <vector>`, which has lots of 
examples of how to access specific data sources.

Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supported Renderers
...............................................................................

Dynamic charts are supported solely with the GD and :ref:`AGG <agg>` renderers. 

Attempting to add a chart layer with any other renderer (e.g. PDF or SWF) will 
result in an error. Rendering quality with the GD renderer is less than optimal, 
especially with small graphs, due to the lack of subpixel rendering functions.

Output from AGG and GD Renderers

Adding a Chart Layer to a Mapfile
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Layer Type
...............................................................................

A new type of layer has been added to the mapfile syntax. To specify a chart 
layer, use

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
    ...
        TYPE CHART
        ...
    END

No other specific keywords have been added in order to keep the number of 
different keywords to a minimum in the mapfile syntax, therefore all the 
chart specific configuration is determined by PROCESSING directives.

Specifying the Size of each Chart
...............................................................................

The size of each chart is specified by the CHART_SIZE directive. If two values 
are given for this parameter, this will specify the width and height of each 
chart (this only applies for bar graphs). By default, the charts are 20x20 
pixels.

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
        TYPE CHART
        PROCESSING "CHART_SIZE=21" # specify size of the chart for pie or bar graphs
        #PROCESSING "CHART_SIZE=20 10" # specify width and height for bar graphs
        ...
    END

From version 5.2 and onwards, the diameter of a pie chart can be bound to an
attribute,using the CHART_SIZE_RANGE PROCESSING attribute:

.. code-block:: mapfile

  PROCESSING "CHART_SIZE_RANGE = itemname minsize maxsize minval maxval"

where:

 - itemname is the name of the attribute that drives the chart size (e.g.
   total_sales)

 - minsize and maxsize are the minimum and maximum chart size values in pixels
   (e.g. "10 100")

 - minval and maxval are the minimum values of the attribute that correspond to
   chart sizes of minsize and maxsize (e.g. 10000 1000000).

If the attribute value is smaller than 'minval' then the chart size will be
minsize pixels, and if the attribute value is larger than maxval, the chart
size will be maxsize pixels.

Specifying the Values to be Plotted
...............................................................................

Each value to be plotted (i.e. a slice in a pie chart, or a bar in a par graph) 
is specified in a CLASS of the chart layer. The value to be plotted is taken 
from the SIZE keyword from the first STYLE block of the class. This is 
semantically a bit awkward, but keeps the number of different keywords to a 
minimum in the mapfile syntax. The value given to the SIZE keyword could of 
course be given a static value, but dynamic charting really only makes sense 
with attribute binding.

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
    ...
        CLASS
            # include a NAME keyword if you want this class to be included 
            # in the legend
            NAME "value 1"
            STYLE
                # specify which value from the data source will be used as the 
                # value for the graph
                SIZE [attribute]
                ...
            END
        END
        CLASS
            ...
        END
    ...
    END

At least 2 CLASS blocks must be specified before charting can occur (but 
you already knew this if you want your charts to convey at least *some* 
information ;) ).

Specifying Style
...............................................................................

The styling of each value in the charts is specified by the usual MapServer 
syntax. Only one style per class is supported, any other STYLE block will 
be silently ignored. Only a subset of the styling keywords are supported:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    STYLE
        SIZE [attribute]
        # specify the fill color
        COLOR r g b 
    
        # if present will draw an outline around the corresponding bar or slice
        OUTLINECOLOR r g b 
    
        #specify the width of the outline if OUTLINECOLOR is present (defaults to 1)
        WIDTH w
    
        # only for pie charts. 'a' is the number of pixels the corresponding 
        # slice will be offset relative to the center of the pie. This is useful 
        # for emphasizing a specific value in each chart. 'b' is required by the 
        # mapfile parser but is ignored.
        OFFSET a b
    END

Pie Charts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the default type of chart that is rendered. This can also be 
specifically set with a PROCESSING keyword in the layer attributes:

::

    PROCESSING "CHART_TYPE=PIE"

For each shape in the layer's datasource, the STYLE SIZE is used to set 
the relative size (value) of each pie slice, with the  angles of the slices 
that are automatically computed so as to form a full pie. For example:

.. code-block:: mapfile
    :linenos:

    LAYER
        NAME "Ages"
        TYPE CHART
        CONNECTIONTYPE postgis
        CONNECTION "blabla"
        DATA "the_geom from demo"
        PROCESSING "CHART_TYPE=pie"
        PROCESSING "CHART_SIZE=30"
        STATUS ON
        CLASS
            NAME "Population Age 0-19"
            STYLE
                SIZE [v1006]
                COLOR 255 244 237
            END
        END
        CLASS
            NAME "Population Age 20-39"
            STYLE
                SIZE [v1007]
                COLOR 255 217 191
            END
        END
        CLASS
            NAME "Population Age 40-59"
            STYLE
                SIZE [v1008]
                COLOR 255 186 140
            END
        END
    END

In the example above, if for a given shape we have v1006=1000, v1007=600 and 
v1008=400 then the actual pie slices for each class will be respectively 
50%, 30% and 20% of the total pie size.

Bar Graphs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bar graph drawing is set with a PROCESSING keyword in the layer attributes:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    PROCESSING "CHART_TYPE=BAR"

For each shape in the layer's datasource, the STYLE SIZE is used to set the 
relative size (value) of each bar in the graph. By default, the vertical axis 
of each bar graph is scaled for the values of the corresponding shape, and 
will always include the origin (=0). For example

 * a shape whose STYLE SIZEs contains values {5,8,10,3} will be plotted 
   on a graph whose vertical axis spans 0 to 10.
 * a shape whose STYLE SIZEs contains values {-5,-8,-10,-3} will be plotted 
   on a graph whose vertical axis spans -10 to 0.
 * a shape whose STYLE SIZEs contains values {-5,-8,10,3} will be plotted 
   on a graph whose vertical axis spans -8 to 10.

Additional PROCESSING directives are used to optionally specify the bounds 
of vertical axes so that the graphs for all the shapes can be plotted with 
the same scale:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    PROCESSING "CHART_BAR_MINVAL=val"
    PROCESSING "CHART_BAR_MAXVAL=val"

Values in the datasource that are above CHART_BAR_MAXVAL or below 
CHART_BAR_MINVAL will be clipped respectively to these values. If only one of 
these directives is included, the other will be automatically adjusted for 
each shape to include at least the origin, i.e. the graphs for all the 
shapes will be in the same scale *only if* all the values are of the 
same sign (positive or negative).
