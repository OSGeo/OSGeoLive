Abstract
========

This Document refers to the syntax of MAP and symbolfiles for MapServer 4.6. 
It is based upon the results of a project carried out at the University of 
Hannover, Institute of Landscape and Nature Conservation. It was initiated by 
Mr. Dipl. Ing. Roland Hachmann. Parts have been taken from a study carried through 
by Karsten Hoffmann, student of Geography and Cartography at the FU Berlin. In 
the context of a hands-on training in the company GraS GmbH Mr. Hoffman mainly 
dealed with the development of symbols.
(`Download study report`_ in German)
His degree dissertation will also concern this subject. 

At the end of this document you will find a link to a paper discussing further 
development of the UMN MapServer software regarding the cartographic rendering 
capabilities. We will try to get around to also translating it to English asap.  
We welcome everybody who is interested in this subject to participate 
in the discussion. As a result of this discussion we want to put together a list 
with change requests and new requirements for UMN MapServer.

Introduction
============

Cartographic characters can be distinguished as point, line and area 
symbols. These symbols may vary depending on their special attributes (variables).
Bertin (1974) created a clear and logical symbol scheme in which symbols can 
be varied referring to graphical variables. The following variables 
are used within MapServer: FORM, SIZE, PATTERN, COLOR and LIGHTNESS. Point and 
area symbols as well as text fonts (ttf) can additionally be displayed 
with a 1-pixel wide frame which we call OUTLINE.

Multiple Rendering and Overlay
------------------------------

Complex cartographic effects can be achieved by rendering the same vector data 
with different attributes, sizes and colors on top of each other. This is an 
easy workaround to creating complex signatures but obviously it will also reflect 
on the performance of the application. Every rendering process of the same 
geometries will  take up additional processor time. 

As an example consider displaying a highway with a black border line, two yellow 
lanes and a red center line. You can achieve this by rendering the same highway 
geometry three times on top of each other. The lowest (in drawing order) is rendered 
as a broad black line with a width of 9 pixel. The second level lines are rendered 
in yellow color with a width of 7 pixel. The topmost layer is displayed as the 
red center line with a width of 3 pixel in size. That way each yellow colored 
lane will have a width of (7-1)/2 = 3 pixel.

This can be a solution for many kinds of cartographic questions, a combination of
different geometry types is also possible. First define a polygon layer as 
TYPE LINE. It will frame the polygons with a line signature. On top of this 
include the same geometry a second time but now as TYPE POLYGON with a symbol 
filling the polygon. This way half of the underlying outline is covered by the 
polygon with the fill symbol. The clipping effect renders an asymmetric line 
symbol. To present the outline without clipping just reorder the layers 
and put the outline presentation on top of the layer with the fill symbol.

Each step growing more complex, yet another way to construct asymmetric line 
signatures for framed faces is to tamper with the original geometries by buffering 
or clipping the original geometry such that the new objects lie inside the 
original polygons or grow over the borders. A new line symbol for these 
geometries can use the OFFSET parameter with the y-value set to -99. This is 
where current development stops short this functions has not been developed 
further. (Anybody need this feature?). Buffer areas may provide ideal geometry
for ambitious cartography, this should be possible as soon as the GEOS library 
is implemented in MapServer. Until then using PostGIS helps to solve a lot of 
problems.       

Symbol Scaling
--------------

There are two basically different ways to handle the display size of symbols 
and cartographic elements in a map at different scales. The size of cartographic 
objects is either set in screen pixel or in real world units.         

- If the size is set in real world units (i.e. meters), then cartographic 
  objects are scalable, they will shrink and grow together with the scale 
  at which the map ist displayed.             

- Object sizes in screen pixel will be displayed in the same size no matter 
  at what scale the map is displayed.             

UMN MapServer implements the screen pixel size type for displaying cartographic 
elements. Additionally the size of cartographic elements can be tied to defined
scales, such that the symbols "grow" and "shrink" with the 
scale. The involved parameters include SYMBOLSCALE, MINSIZE and MAXSIZE settings 
in the MAP file.      

All symbol and style definitions referenced in the following section are contained
in the archive at the end of this document.       

The following figure shows the theoretical structure of cartographic symbols, 
which are also used in UMN MapServer:

   :width: 600

In a MapServer application symbol parameters are taken from the MAP and symbol
file as follows: 

*MAP* file:

- The parameter TYPE defines the type of geometry (point, line or polygon)
  for each layer. The symbols are accordingly rendered as single points,
  along a line or area symbols.
  
- The definition of the color, brightness (through the color parameter),
  size and outline is set inside the STYLE-section of a CLASS-section
  by the parameters COLOR, SIZE and OUTLINECOLOR.
  
- Combining several basic elements to achieve a complex signature
  with several STYLEs inside one layer (observe the display order).
  
*Symbol* file:

- Definition of form and pattern with TYPE, POINTS, IMAGE, FILLED,
  STYLE (meaning fill pattern) and GAP.  
  
The following figure shows the interaction of these elements and explains 
the configuration in the MAP and the SYMBOL file sections necessary for 
rendering cartographic symbols in the map:

Using Cartographic Symbols in UMN MapServer
===========================================

The basic graphic elements in a symbolfile are made up of vectors, truetype
fonts, raster images or cartolines and are defined by the TYPE-parameter. The
following section explains all four types of basic graphic elements and how
they can be combined to create complex cartographic symbols.  

Scaling of Symbols
------------------

The parameter SYMBOLSCALE in the LAYER section specifies the scale number at
which the symbol or text label is displayed in exactly the pixel size defined
by the SIZE parameter. Observe that the SIZE parameter is tightly connected
to the SYMBOLSCALE parameter. The parameters MAXSIZE and MINSIZE inside the
STYLE block limit the rendering of symbols to the maximum and minimum scale
specified here. Both the minimum reasonable display size for symbols and the
minimum of space required to display a symbol within a polygon should be
observed.

Symbols of TYPE PIXMAP will not be scaled if used as line and polygon fills!
In addition PIXMAPs will not display nicely when rescaled due to roundings
caused by the integer arithmetics of the GD. The basic elements of a composite
cartographic symbol may change their relative positions to each other, especially
at very small scales (large number). They can also slightly change their form
when they are displayed as tiny little images.

Furthermore the gaps of line symbols (the pattern itself) will not be
scaled. The gaps stay fixed whereas the width is scaled. This can result in
strange effects seeming to change the original pattern.

There is no possibility to separately define the display intervals (gaps) with
MINSCALE and MAXSCALE in the STYLE-section (anybody need this?), so this tuning
has to be solved at the LAYER level. TO do this create several layers with the
same geometries for different scale levels and specify the appropriate sizes
accordingly.  

Always observe that cartographic symbols depend a lot on the scale! So be careful
with the interaction of content, symbols and scale when creating projects.
All three parameters heavily interact and have to be coordinated to produce
a good map.  

Symbols of TYPE VECTOR and ELLIPSE
----------------------------------

The TYPE VECTOR defines the form of a symbol by setting x- and y-values in a
local caresian coordinate system with the origin at the upper left corner.
Each symbol is parenthesized by the tags POINTS and END. The maximum number of
points can be increased by changing the parameter MS_MAXVECTORPOINTS in the
file mapsymbols.h. The current default is 100. Note that by setting the end
point equal to the start point you obtain a closed form (polygon). To use the
coordinates -99 -99 to break a line, the following point will not be connected
by a line with the preceding one.   

When creating symbols of the TYPE VECTOR you should observe some style guidelines.
Avoid downtilted lines in area symbols, as they will lead to heavy aliasing
effects. Furthermore you should not go below a useful minimum size, which is
relevant for all types of symbols. Keep in mind that the points in the local
coordinate system are rendered as pixel images, thus only integer values make
any sense. Every symbol of the TYPE VECTOR is first rendered as a pixel image
and then added to the geometry. This is the basic principle of the GD graphic
kernel. PIXMAP symbols may be used directly for drawing.  

To create circles and ellipses use the TYPE ELLIPSE. These forms are created
by setting the x and y values as the radius of the circle or ellipse inside
POINTS and END.  

Construction of Point Symbols
-----------------------------

The following figure shows how to combine several basic elements to create a 
new point symbol. The combination is achieved by  adding several STYLEs within 
one layer. Each basic element references one item of the SYMBOL file, which 
are centered and overlayed when rendered.  

Notice that the SIZE parameter in the STYLE section only refers to the width
of the symbol (size in the y-direction). An edgewise rectangle will thus display
smaller than a lying rectangle, although both have the same SIZE parameter.
When combining several point elements on top of each other, they will not always
be centered correctly. We have not found a regular rule yet. We can only recommend
to set an even-numbered  SIZE for combined elements. Combining elements with
even and odd numbered SIZE parameters seem to have larger irregularities.

**Figure3: Construction of Point Symbols**

.. image:: ../../images/point-symbols.png
   :height: 400
   :width: 600

Construction of Line Symbols
----------------------------

For displaying line geometries most often a simple point symbol (filled circle
/ SYMBOL 0) is used. This point is painted for each pixel along the line, giving
a continuous line with rounded ends. To create line patterns use the STYLE section
of the SYMBOL file (do not confuse this with the STYLE-section of the CLASS object).
Here you state how many pixel of the section shall be displayed and how many
are left blank. This pattern will be repeated as many times as that pattern
will fit into the element. The following figure shows this effect. Unfortunately up 
to now no OFFSET (start gap) can be defined to create asymetric patterns. (anybody need this?) 

**Figure4: Construction of Line Symbols**

.. image:: ../../images/line-symbols.png
   :height: 400
   :width: 600

When using the point character for rendering all line features with have rounded
ends. This can be a desired effect or not, it gets more obvious the larger the
width of line is set. Alternatively a rectangle can be used to generate a line.
It can be enhanced with a STYLE-parameter to create line patterns (see below).

+----------------------------------+---------------------------------+

The STYLE parameter can be used for elements of the SYMBOL file with the
TYPE VECTOR, ELLIPSE, CARTOLINE and PIXMAP. It will define the number of
intervals in which the symbol is rendered. This can be done using the GAP
parameter with TRUETYPE symbols (see below). 

When combining of several symbols on a line, they will be positioned on the
baseline which is defined by the geometry of the object in pixel coordinates.
Again we face the problem of centering. In most cases MapServer corectly centers
symbols. The combination of a line displayed in 6 pixel width and overlayed with
4 pixel width results in a line symbol with a 1 pixel border. If the cartographic
symbol is to contain a centered line with a width of 1 pixel, then the SIZE
parameters have to be reconfiguredfor example to 7 and a 5 pixel. As a rule
of thumb only combine even numbered or odd numbered SIZE parameters (see above). 

In the STYLE section of the MAP file an OFFSET parameter can be set to shift
symbols or characters in the x and y direction. Unfortunately the displacement
is set relative to the map border, not the inclination of the line gemoetry
(with the exception: OFFSET n -99). Therefore the iterated characters are all
shifted in the same direction, independent of which direction the line takes
(see Example 2). To generate asymmetrical line symbols apply -99 for the y
value of the OFFSET. Then the x-value defines the distance from a parallel
to the original geometry, for which the selected symbol is used (what a pity
this wasn't documented anywhere!).

Area Symbols
------------

Areas (polygons) can be filled with elements of the SYMBOL file to create e.g.
hatches and graticules. These are by default rendered without spacing one after
the other in x and y direction and fill out the whole polygon. Simple line
hatches (e.g. horizontal, vertical and diagonal) can be created by filling the
polygon with a line symbol from the SYMBOL file (see example 5). 

The SIZE parameter in the STYLE section for line hatches only specifies the
distance between the lines and not their width. Thus in these hatches all lines
will always have a width of 1 pixel. Unfortunately there is no additional
parameter to define the line width (Anybody need this feature?). Notice that
the SIZE parameter is interpreted by MapServer differently for horizontal and
vertical lines. Vertical lines with a SIZE parameter of 8 pixel result in a
distance of 8 pixel between the lines. Horizontal lines with the same SIZE
parameter are instead renderes with a much smaller gap (see example 5). For
creating cross hatches composed of vertical and horizontal lines the best
method is to use a simple cross from the SYMBOL file. Polygons can also be
filled with other POINT elements to obtain special patterns (e.g. with circles
or triangles).

Signatures of TYPE PIXMAP
-------------------------

Symbols of the TYPE PIXMAP are simply small raster images. The name of the
raster images are specified in the SYMBOL file with the parameter IMAGE.
MapServer supports the raster formats GIF and PNG. Observe the color depth
of the images and avoid using 24 bit PNG symbols displayed in 8 bit mode as
this may cause unexpected color leaps. When using raster images the color
cannot be modified in the SMBOL file subsequently. But you can specify a
color with the TRANPARENT parameter which will not be displayed - i.e. it
will be transparent. As a result all underlying objects and colors are visible. 

The SIZE parameter defines the size of PIXMAP symbols when used as point symbols.
Observe that the pixel structure will show when the SIZE grows too large. Prevent
this from happening by setting a MAXSIZE parameter. When using PIXMAPS as line
symbols or as fill symbols for polygons they will not be resized but are displayed
in the original size. So the use of PIXMAP STYLE objects for signatures with
a high need of scaling is rather limited.   

PIXMAP symbols are always rendered respective to the map border and will not
follow the inclination of a line or polygon outline. Only truetype font symbols
can follow an inclined line geometry, although with some defects (see below).   

To create more complex area symbols, e.g. with defined distances between single
characters or hatches with broad lines, raster images are probably the most
suitable objects. Depending on the desired pattern you have to generate the
raster image with high precision using a graphic editor. To obtain a regular
allocation of symbols with defined spacing you could use the raster image as
shown in Figure1.   

**Figure5: Raster image for a regular polygon symbol fill**

.. image:: ../../images/polygon-symbol-fill.png
   :height: 400
   :width: 600
   
**Figure6: Raster image for a hatched fill**

.. image:: ../../images/hatch-symbol-fill.png
   :height: 400
   :width: 600

Instead of using circles you can use different characters. B defines the width
and H the height of the raster image. For a regular arrangment of symbols in
a 45 degree angle B = H. For symbols, which are regularly arranged in parallel
and without offset between each other one centered symbol with same x and y
distances to the imageborder is enough. A regular hatch with wider lines can
be created by using the raster image in fig. 2. To create a 45 degree hatch
use:  

::

   B = H and x = y
   
When using the MapServer legend observe that each raster PIXMAP is displayed
only once in the original size in the middle of the legend box.  

See the example below of some PIXMAP symbols, which can be used as area symbols with
transparency. The raster images were created using FreeHand, finished with
Photoshop and exported to PNG with special attention regarding the color palette.
Observe that you *have* to specify a COLOR in the STYLE section of the
CLASS to display raster PIXMAPS although it has no influence on the output
and color of the image.

Signatures of TYPE CARTOLINE
----------------------------

The TYPE Cartoline is not really an independent SYMBOL type or basic element
but it is useful for creating line signatures. The advantage over the above
types is the antialising of lines with any width.
Conventional lines can only use antialising with a width of 1 pixel. This line
type supports the ANTIALIAS parameter in the STYLE block of the CLASS definition
just like the truetype fonts and symbols. Here you can also define line patterns
and offsets. The design of the line ends can be controled with the
LINECAP parameter. The LINECAP value BUTT stopps the signature exactly at the
end of the top line.
Author of this features is Tomas Krecmer (`tokr(a)tmapy.cz`_).
If you have questions concerning this type of signature or suggestions for
improvement please contact the author.

     END
   END 
   
LINEJOIN
...............................................................................

The different values for the parameter LINEJOIN have the following visual effects
(see the following figure).  Default is 'not set' but do not specify the string 
'not set', just omit the parameter LINEJOIN.

Miter
  follow line borders until they intersect, fill the resulting area.

Round
  see above
  
Bevel
  see above

None
  Lines will not be connected but drawn with LINECAPP 'butt' at the respective ends. 
           
.. image:: ../../images/miter-linejoin.jpg

LINEJOINMAXSIZE
...............................................................................


Specify the maximum length of m (only relevant for LINEJOIN type MITER).
The value is a multiplication factor (default 3). The actual max length is
calculated as follows:

::

   m - current join size
   d - symbol size
   m_max = d * LINEJOINMAXSIZE
   
If current *m > m_max* then the connection length will be set to m_max.

Signatures of TYPE TRUETYPE
---------------------------

Finally you can use symbols from truetype fonts. The symbol settings are also
defined in the SYMBOL file. Specify the ASCII number of the symbol to be used
in the CHARACTER parameter. Add the ALIAS name of the font file to the parameter
FONT as defined in the file fonts.list. Remember to set the FONTSET parameter
in the MAP file to link the correct fonts.list file. With the parameter ANTIALIAS
you define whether to apply antialiasing to the symbols or characters. It is
recommended to do this especially with more complex symbols and and whenever
they don't fit well into the raster matrix or show a visible pixel structure.
Set a POSITION [ul|uc|ur|cl|cc|cr|ll|lc|lr] relative to the geometric origin of
the geometry. In the STYLE section of the LAYER object it is possible to define
colors for true type symbols (as with signatures of the TYPE VECTOR).

When using truetype chracters to render complex line symbols, you can define the
distance in pixel until the symbol is repeated by setting the GAP parmeter in
the SYMBOL file. A more complicated pattern like the STYLE parameters for VECTOR,
ELLIPSE or PIXMAP type symbols cannot be used not (Anybody need this feature?).
The OFFSET parameter is currently not implemented yet. Truetype symbols follow
the inclination of the accompanying line.

When using asymmetrical symbols they unfortunately do not always follow the
outside or the inside, left or right of a line but change. If possible symbols
will always be displayed upside (which makes a lot of sense for string characters,
what true type fonts basically are). On vertical lines symbols are rendered
to the right or left side depending on the drawing direction of the line. If
the line is drawn from bottom to top, the truetype symbol is displayed to the
left, if the line is drawn from top to bottom, the symbol is displayed to the
right (see table below). In left picture in the table the line is drawn
clockwise and in the right picture drawn counterclockwise.

To find out the character number of a symbol use one of the following options:

- Use the software FontMap (Shareware, with free trial version for download, thanks Till!)

- Use the MS Windows truetype map
 
- Trial and Error :-) 

Please note that the numbering of the so-called "symbol fonts" starts at 61440! 
So if you want to use character &#84, you have to use 61440 + 84 = &#61524. 
(ain't that a pain!!)

Current Problems / Open Issues
==============================

The current version of MapServer renders open symbols (e.g. a cross) and empty
symbols of the TYPE VECTOR incorrectly by filling them. This bug has been removed
during our code examination and should be eliminated with a future release.
Additionaly the OUTLINECOLOR-parameter can not be used to create a 1 pixel
outline for symbols and characters on a line. This can be achieved in a more
flexible way as mentioned above. Another problem concerns the use of line patterns
(e.g. dashed line) on features with many points and nooks. The line pattern
will then often be displayed irregularly (see Table9).

All symbols in this document were created with MAP files and SYMBOL files, which
can be `downloaded`_. If you want to use this MAP
file please note, that your MapServer must at least be able to handle with 50
symbols. Otherwise you get an error while loading the SYMBOL files.

I hope that this document will help you to present your data in a cartographically
nice manner with the UMN MapServer and explains some basics and possibilities
of the concept of the UMN MapServer as well as some weakness. It would be great
to put together a cartographic symbols library for the profit of everyone.
This especially concerns truetype-fonts, which were developed for some projects
and contain some typical signatures for cartographic needs.
