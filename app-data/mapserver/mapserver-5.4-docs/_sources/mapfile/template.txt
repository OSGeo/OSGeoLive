Introduction
============

Templates are used:

- to define the look of a MapServer CGI application interface and
- to present the results of a query. 

They guide the presentation of results, either a query or a map, to the user.
Templates are almost always HTML files although they can also be a URL (e.g..
http://www.somewhere.com/[ATTRIBUTE]/info.html). URL templates can only be
used with simple QUERY or ITEMQUERY results so many substitutions defined
below are not available for them. Simple pan/zoom interfaces use a single
template file while complicated queries often require many templates.
Templates often use JavaScript to enhance the basic interface.

Notes
-----

- All :ref:`CGI parameters <cgi>` can be referenced in template substitutions,
  MapServer specific parameters as well as user defined ones. In principle
  parameters are handed through by the MapServer 1:1. This feature is
  essential for implementing MapServer applications.

  The reference below only lists special template substitution strings which
  are needed to obtain information modified by the MapServer, e.g. a new
  scale, query results, etc.

- Template substitution strings are case sensitive.

- Attribute item substitutions must be the same case as the item names in the 
  dbase file.

- ArcView and ArcInfo generally produce dbase files with item names that are
  all uppercase. Appropriate URL encoding (i.e. ' ' to '+') is applied when
  templates are URLs.

- Some substitutions are also available in escaped form (i.e. URL encoded).

As an example this is needed when generating links within a template. This
might pass the current mapextent to a new MapServer call. *[mapext]* is
substituted by a space delimited set of lower left and upper right
coordinates. This would break the URL. *[mapext_esc]* is substituted by a
proper encoded set.

Format
======

Templates are simply HTML files or URL strings that contains special
characters that are replaced by :ref:`mapserv` each time the template is
processed. The simple substitution allows information such as active layers or
the spatial extent to be passed from the user to :ref:`mapserv` and back
again. Most often the new values are dumped into form variables that will be
passed on again. The list of special characters and form variables is given
below. HTML templates can include just about anything including JavaScript and
Java calls.

In HTML files, the attribute values can be inside quotes(""). Writing
attribute values inside quotes allows you to set special characters in
value that you couldn't use normaly (ie: ],=," and space). To write a
single quote in a attribute value, just use two quotes ("").

General
-------

[version]
     The MapServer version number. 
[id]
     Unique session id. The id can be passed in via a form but is more commonly
     generated 
     by the software. In that case the id is a concatenation of UNIX time (or NT
     equivalent) and the process id. Unless you're getting more requests in a 
     second than the system has process ids the id can be considered unique. ;-> 
  
[host]
     Hostname of the web server. 

[port]
     Port the web server is listening to. 
  
[post or get variable name], [post or get variable name_esc]
     The contents of any variables passed to the MapServer, whether they were
     used or not, can be echoed this way. One use might be to have the user set 
     a map title or north arrow style in an interactive map composer. The system 
     doesn't care about the values, but they might be real important in creating 
     the final output, e.g. if you specified a CGI parameter like myvalue=.... 
     you can access this in the template file with [myvalue].

     Also available as escaped version. 
  
[web_meta data key],[web_meta data key_esc]
     Web object meta data access (e.g [web_projection]

     Also available as escaped version. 

[errmsg], [errmsg_esc]
     Current error stack output. Various error messages are delimited by 
     semi-colons.

     Also available as escaped version. 
     
File Reference
--------------

[img]
     Path (relative to document root) of the new image, just the image name if 
     IMAGE_URL is not set in the mapfile.

     In a map interface template, [img] is substituted with the path to the map image. 
     In a query results template, it is substituted with the path to the querymap 
     image (if a :ref:`QUERYMAP` object is defined in the :ref:`mapfile`). 
     
[ref]
     Path (relative to document root) of the new reference image. 
     
[legend]
     Path (relative to document root) of new legend image rendered by the MapServer.

     Since version 3.5.1 a new HTML Legend template is provided by MapServer. If a 
     template is defined in the :ref:`mapfile` the [legend] string is replaced by the processed 
     legend as. See the :ref:`html_legend` for details.
     
[scalebar]
     Path (relative to document root) of new scalebar image. 

[queryfile]
     Path to the query file (if savequery was set as a :ref:`CGI Parameter <cgi>`). 

[map]
     Path to the map file (if savemap was set as a :ref:`CGI Parameter <cgi>`).   
     
Image Geometry
--------------

[center]
     Computed image center in pixels. Useful for setting imgxy form variable when 
     map sizes change. 

[center_x], [center_y]
     Computed image center X or Y coordinate in pixels. 

[mapsize], [mapsize_esc]
     Current image size in cols and rows (separated by spaces).

     Also available as escaped version. 
     
[mapwidth], [mapheight]
     Current image width or height. 

[scaledenom]
     Current image scale. The exact value is not appropriate for user 
     information but essential for some applications. The value can be rounded 
     e.g. using JavaScript or server side post processing. 

[scale] - deprecated 
     Since MapServer 5.0 the proper parameter to use is [scaledenom]
     instead.  The deprecated [scale] is the current image scale. The exact
     value is not appropriate for user information but essential for some
     applications. The value can be rounded e.g. using JavaScript or server side
     post processing. 
     
[cellsize]
     Size of an pixel in the current image in map units. Useful for distance 
     measurement tools in user interfaces.

     mixx miny maxx maxy

     Available arguments:

     - escape=

     be given, second the tables fields can be accessed similar to the layers 
     attribute data. Available only when processing query results.

     By default the attributes are encoded especially for HTML representation. In 
     addition the escaped version (for use in URLs) as well as the raw data is available. 

[join_Join name]
     One-to-many joins: The more complex variant. If the join type is multiple 
     (one-to-many) the template is replaced by the set of header, template file 
     and footer specified in the :ref:`mapfile`. 
     
[metadata_meta data key], [metadata_meta data key_esc]
     Queried layer meta data access (e.g [metadata_projection]

     Also available as escaped version. 

For query modes that allow for multiple result sets, the following string 
substitutions are available. For FEATURESELECT and FEATURENSELECT modes the totals a
re adjusted so as not to include the selection layer. The selection layer results 
ARE available for display to the user.

Example Template
================

A small example to give an idea how to work with templates. Note that it covers 
MapServer specific templates (e.g. the [map], [mapext]) and user defined templates 
(e.g. [htmlroot] or [program]) used to store application settings.
