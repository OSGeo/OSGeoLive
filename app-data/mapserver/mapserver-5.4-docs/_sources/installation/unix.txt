=============================================================================
 Introduction
=============================================================================

The University of Minnesota's MapServer is an open-source and freely 
available map rendering engine for the web. Due to its open-source nature, 
it can be compiled on a wide variety of platforms and operating systems. 
We will focus on how to obtain, compile and install MapServer on UNIX-like 
platforms. 

You might also check the `MapServerCompilation <http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/wiki/MapServerCompilation>`__
wiki page for additional information.

=============================================================================
 Obtaining the necessary software
=============================================================================

You can obtain the MapServer source code as well as the demo package from the 
:ref:`download` section.

You can also get the latest MapServer source code from :ref:`svn`.

  later is required to use curved (following) labels, and version 2.0.34
  is required for antialiasing (1 pixel wide lines/outlines). 

* `zlib <http://www.gzip.org/zlib/>`__: Zlib should be on your system by 
  default.  1.2.1 is the current release with security patches. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Highly Recommended Libraries
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


* `libproj <http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/>`__: libproj provides projection 
  support for MapServer.  Version 4.4.6 or greater is required.

  Flash output to MapServer.  Version 0.2a is required. Later versions are 
  not known to work.

=============================================================================
 libgd
=============================================================================

There are a number of issues that you should be aware of when using GD in 
combination with MapServer.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Minimum libgd versions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

MapServer aggressively takes advantage of new features and bug fixes in the 
latest versions of libgd.  The minimum required version to run MapServer is 
2.0.29.  Upgrading to at least 2.0.34 is advised as it includes an important
bug fix for antialiased lines.  Configure should detect which version of 
libgd you have installed, but you  can quickly check yourself by issuing the 
following command: 

::

    gdlib-config --version

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 libiconv
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you intend to use international character sets, your version of libgd 
*must* be compiled against the GNU iconv libraries.  If you are using a 
pre-packaged version, it is very likely that this is the case.  To check 
for yourself, issue the following command and look for '-liconv' in the output:

::

    gdlib-config --libs

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Pre-packaged/system libraries
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you intend to use your system's libgd, ensure that you have the development 
package also installed so MapServer can find and use the appropriate headers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 MacOSX
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A useful FAQ on for libgd on OSX is available at 
http://www.libgd.org/DOC_INSTALL_OSX

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 FreeType support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The GD you compile MapServer against MUST be compiled against the FreeType 
library in order to use TrueType fonts. MapServer no longer uses it's own 
interface to FreeType, using it through GD instead.

When you run your "configure" script, look for the following output:

::

    using GD ( -DUSE_GD_GIF -DUSE_GD_PNG -DUSE_GD_JPEG 
               -DUSE_GD_WBMP -DUSE_GD_TTF -DGD_HAS_GDIMAGEGIFPTR) from system libs.
          
If your GD is built against FreeType, you will see either 
"-DUSE_GD_TTF" (Or "-DUSE_GD_FT" for Freetype 2.x) part. If it's missing, 
you will need to recompile your GD to make sure you include FreeType 
support. See the GD documentation for more information.

Also note that the configure script looks for the FreeType library 
separately as well, generating output looking somewhat like this:

::

    checking where FreeType is installed...
    checking for FT_Init_FreeType in -lfreetype... yes
	    using libfreetype -lfreetype from system libs.
	
Even though you have FreeType installed on your system *and* the 
configure script finds it, does *NOT* mean you will have TrueType 
font support. GD *MUST* be compiled against FreeType either way.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1px Anti-Aliasing and segfaults
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Versions of libgd earlier than 2.0.34 contain a one very 
significant bug and will *always* cause a segfault if 
you attempt to do one pixel wide antialiasing.  You can manually
patch older gd's, or better yet upgrade to at least GD 2.0.34. 

In gd.c, function gdImageSetAAPixelColor() change:

::

    int dr,dg,db,p,r,g,b;
    p = gdImageGetPixel(im,x,y);

to

::

    int dr,dg,db,p,r,g,b;
    if (!gdImageBoundsSafeMacro (im, x, y)) return;
    p = gdImageGetPixel(im,x,y);

More detail about this patch (if you need any) was described by Steve Lime 
in a `post to mapserver-users`_. 

.. note: 

    Windows builds that are built with the buildkit (this includes MS4W 
    and OSGeo4W) have this patch already and do not need to be updated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Curved label support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANGLE FOLLOW, a new feature that allows MapServer to draw curved labels 
about a linear feature like a road, requires libgd 2.0.29 and TrueType 
font support.  Configure should autodetect if you have a sufficient 
libgd and TrueType support to be able to use this feature.

=============================================================================
Anti-Grain Geometry Support
=============================================================================
Since version 5.0 MapServer supports the AGG rendering backend.
Download the 2.4 tarball from the antigrain website and just type make in
the root directory. If you intend on using mapscript, you must beforehand 
tweak the agg makefile to add -fPIC to the compiler options.

=============================================================================
 OGC Support
=============================================================================
MapServer provides support for many `OGC <http://www.opengeospatial.org>`__ 
specifications.  At 4.2.3, it provides support for WMS (Web Mapping Service), 
SLD (Styled Layer Descriptor), WFS (Web Feature Service), and experimental 
support for WCS (Web Coverage Service).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 WMS support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

WMS Server
-------------------
Support for this specification is automatically enabled when you 
include PROJ.4 support. (--with-proj)
You can check this yourself by looking for the following 
in your "configure" output:

::

    checking whether we should include WMS support...
        OGC WMS compatibility enabled (-DUSE_WMS).

If, for some reason you DON'T want WMS support, you can force it off 
by passing "--without-wms" to your configure script.  

More information on using this feature is available in the WMS Server 
HOWTO available on the MapServer website.

WMS Client
-------------------
Cascading is also supported. This allows mapserver to transparently 
fetch remote layers over WMS, basically acting like a client, and combine 
them with other layers to generate the final map.

In order to enable this feature, you will need to pass the "--with-wmsclient" 
option to the configure script. MapServer will automatically look for 
libcurl, which is also required.

To verify that the WMS Client feature is enabled, check the 
output from the configure script:

::

    checking whether we should include WMS Client Connections support...
        OGC WMS Client Connections enabled (-DUSE_WMS_LYR).

Note that this feature is disabled by default, you have to 
specifically request it.

More information on using this feature is available in the 
WMS Client HOWTO available on the MapServer website.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 WFS support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

WFS Server
-------------------
Support for this specification is enabled by passing the configure 
script the "--with-wfs" option. OGR and PROJ.4 support is required.

You can check this yourself by looking for the following in your 
"configure" output:

::

    checking whether we should include WFS Server support...
        OGC WFS Server support enabled (-DUSE_WFS_SVR).

Note that this feature is disabled by default, you have to 
specifically request it.

More information on using this feature is available in the 
WFS Server HOWTO available on the MapServer website.

WFS Client
-------------------
MapServer can also act as a WFS client. This effectively means that MapServer 
reads it's data from a remote server's WFS output and renders it into a map, 
just like it would when reading data from a shapefile.

In order to enable this feature, you will need to make sure you include 
OGR (Built with Xerces support) and PROJ.4 support, and pass the 
"--with-wfsclient" option to your configure script. MapServer will automatically 
look for libcurl, which is also required.

To verify that the WFS Client feature is enabled, check the output 
from the configure script:

::

    checking whether we should include WFS Client Connections support...
        OGC WFS Client Connections enabled (-DUSE_WFS_LYR).

Note that this feature is disabled by default, you have to specifically 
request it.

More information on using this feature is available in the WFS Client 
HOWTO available on the MapServer website.

=============================================================================
 Spatial Warehousing
=============================================================================
MapServer can use a wide variety of sources of data input. One of the 
solutions growing in popularity is to use spatially enabled databases to 
store data, and to use them directly to draw maps for the web.

Here you will find out how to enable mapserver to talk to one of these 
products. Please refer to the MapFile reference for more details on how to 
use these. This section only details how to compile MapServer for their use.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PostGIS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`PostGIS <http://postgis.refractions.net>`__ adds support for geographic 
objects to the `PostgreSQL <http://www.postresql.org>`__ object-relational 
database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables" the PostgreSQL server, 
allowing it to be used as a backend spatial database for geographic 
information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension.
PostGIS is included in many distributions' packaging system, but you can also 
roll your own if needed.

MapServer can use PostGIS as a data source. In order to do so simply use 
"--with-postgis" when running your configure script.

::

  --with-postgis=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_config

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ArcSDE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MapServer allows you to use SDE as a data source both for geometry and 
attributes. In order to achieve this, you must have the SDE client librairies 
at your disposition, and have them installed on the machine running MapServer.

In order to enable SDE support in MapServer, you have to compile it 
with two options specified:

::

    --with-sde=/opt/sdeexe90
    --with-sde-version=90

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Oracle Spatial
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oracle's Spatial Warehousing cartridge is also supported by MapServer. 
In order to connect to it, you will need to compile MapServer against 
the Oracle libraries by passing the "--with-oraclespatial" argument to 
your configure script.  You will very likely need an ORACLE_HOME environment 
variable set to have it configure things correctly.

::

    --with-oraclespatial=/opt/oracle

=============================================================================
 Compiling
=============================================================================
First prepare the ground by making sure all of your required and/or 
recommended libraries are installed before attempting to compile MapServer.  
This will make your life much less complicated ;).  Here is the order that I 
usually use:

1. Compile GD.  This often means acquiring libjpeg, libpng, zlib, and 
   freetype before actually compiling the library.  You shouldn't have too 
   much trouble finding binaries of the libraries that GD requires, and 
   often, they will already be installed with your system.  On unix, I've
   had very little luck finding pre-compiled binaries of the required 
   GD library.  See `libgd`_ section for notes about patching libgd if you 
   plan to use antialiasing.
    
2. Compile GDAL/OGR.  Describing how to compile GDAL/OGR is beyond the scope
   of this document.  If you have requirements for lots of different formats,
   make sure to install those libraries first.  I often find that building 
   up a GDAL/OGR library often takes as long as compiling MapServer itself!   

3. Compile Proj.4.  Proj.4 is a straight-forward configure/make/make install 
   library.  
   
4. Compile libcurl.  libcurl is a straight-forward configure/make/make install
   library.

5. Compile/install optional libraries.  These might include SDE, PostGIS,
   Oracle Spatial, AGG, Ming, PDFlib, or MyGIS.  Mix and match as you need
   them.

6. Unpack the MapServer tarball and cd into the mapserver directory:

   ::
   
      [user@host user]$ tar -zxvf mapserver-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

7. Configure your environment using "configure".  I often place my configure
   command in its own file and changes its mode to be executable (+x) to save 
   typing and have a record of how MapServer was configured.

   ::
    
      ./configure     --with-sde=/usr/sde/sdeexe90 \
                      --with-sde-version=90 \
                      --with-ogr=/usr/local/bin/gdal-config \
                      --with-gdal=/usr/local/bin/gdal-config \
                      --with-httpd=/usr/sbin/httpd \
                      --with-wfsclient \
                      --with-wmsclient \
                      --enable-debug \
                      --with-curl-config=/usr/bin/curl-config \
                      --with-proj=/usr/local \
                      --with-tiff \
                      --with-gd=/usr/local/ \
                      --with-jpeg \
                      --with-freetype=/usr/ \
                      --with-oraclespatial=/usr/oracle \
                      --with-threads \
                      --with-wcs \
                      --with-postgis=/usr/local/database/bin/pg_config \
                      --with-libiconv=/usr \ # new in 4.8
                      --with-geos=/usr/local/bin/geos-config \ # new in 4.8
                      --with-libiconv=/usr \ # new in 4.8
                      --with-xml2-config=/usr/bin/xml2-config \ # new in 4.10
                      --with-sos \ # new in 4.10
                      --with-agg=/path/to/agg-2.4
                      

8. Now that you have configured your build options and selected all the 
   libraries you wish mapserver to use, you're ready to compile the 
   source code into an executable.
   
   This is actually quite simple, just execute "make":
   
   ::
   
      [user@host mapserver]$ make

9. There is no *make install* step in the installation of MapServer.  The 
   output of the compilation of MapServer is a binary executable that you 
   can use in a CGI execution environment.
   
   To make sure all went well, look for the file called *mapserv*
   
   ::
   
      [user@host mapserver]$ ls -al mapserv
      -rwxr-xr-x    1 user     user       351177 Dec 21 11:38 mapserv
   
   A simple test is to try and run it:
   
   ::
   
      [user@host mapserver]$ ./mapserv
      This script can only be used to decode form results and
      should be initiated as a CGI process via a httpd server.
      [user@host mapserver]$
   
   The message above is perfectly normal, and means exactly what it says. 
   If you get anything else, something went terribly wrong.

=============================================================================
 Installation
=============================================================================
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 MapServer binary
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The MapServer program itself consists of only one file, the "mapserv" binary 
executable. This is a CGI executable, meant to be called and run by your 
web server.

In this section, we will assume you are running Apache under its default 
directory structure in /usr/local/apache. You may need to have privileges 
to edit your httpd.conf (the main apache configuration file), or have 
someone (such as your webmaster) help you with the configuration details.

The main goal is to get the "mapserv" binary installed in a publicly 
accessible directory that is configured to run CGI programs and scripts.

The basic install
-------------------
Under a default configuration, the CGI directory is "/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin" 
(RedHat users will use "/home/httpd/cgi-bin"). Placing the mapserv file in this 
directory makes it accessible by the following URL: 
"http://yourhostname.com/cgi-bin/mapserv". When accessing this URL through your 
web client, you should expect the following output if all has worked well: 
"No query information to decode. QUERY_STRING is set, but empty." If you get 
this message, you're done installing MapServer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Common problems
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
File permissions
-------------------
The most common problem one is likely to encounter when attempting to 
install the binary are permissions issues:

*  You do not have write permissions into your web server's CGI Directory. 
   Ask your webmaster to install the file for you.
*  The web server gives you a "403 Permission denied" error. Make sure the 
   user the web server runs as (usually "nobody") has execute permission on 
   the binary executable. Making the file world executable is perfectly 
   fine and safe:
   ::
   
      [user@host cgi-bin]$ chmod o+x mapserv

Apache errors
-------------------
You may receive a few different type of errors as well if your web 
server configuration isn't right: 

*  500 Internal server error: This is a fairly generic error message. 
   All it basically tells you is that the web server was unsuccessful 
   in running the program. You will have to consult the web server's error 
   log to find out more, and may need to enlist the help of your 
   webmaster/system administrator.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Where to go once you've got it compiled
