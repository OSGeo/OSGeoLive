Interoperability is increasingly becoming a focus point for organizations that
distribute and share data over the Internet. The `Open Geospatial Consortium
<http://www.opengeospatial.org/>`__ (OGC) focuses on the development of
publicly available geospatial web standards. MapServer supports numerous OGC
standards, allowing users to publish and consume data and services in an
application neutral implementation manner.
