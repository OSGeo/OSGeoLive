Introduction
============

MapServer can retrieve and display data from a WFS server.  The following
document explains how to display data from a WFS server using MapServer.

A WFS ( Web Feature Service ) publishes feature-level geospatial data to the
web.  This means that it is possible to use this data as a data source to 
render a map.  In effect, this is not unlike having a shapefile accessible 
over the web, only it's not a shapefile, it's XML-Encoded geospatial data 
(GML to be exact), including both geometry AND attribute information. 

WFS-Related Information
-----------------------

Although in-depth understanding of WFS and GML is neither necessary nor 
required in order to implement a MapServer application that reads remote 
WFS data, it is recommended to at least get aquainted with the concepts and 
basic functionality of both.  Here are the official references (including a 
newly added OGC workshop with MapServer):

- `OGC Web Feature Service Implementation Specification`_.
- `Geography Markup Language Implementation Specification`_.
- `MapServer OGC Web Services Workshop package`_.

.. _`MapServer OGC Web Services Workshop package`: http://ms-ogc-workshop.maptools.org/

Software Requirements
---------------------

In order to enable MapServer to serve WFS, it MUST be compiled against certain libraries:

- PROJ.4: The reprojection library. Version 4.4.3 or greater is required.
- GDAL/OGR: I/O support librairies. Version 1.1.8 or greater is required.
- LibCURL: Used to help MapServer act as an HTTP client. Version 7.10 or greater is required.

Please see the MapServer UNIX Compilation and Installation HOWTO for detailed instructions 
on compiling mapserver with support for these librairies and features.  For Windows users, 
look on the MapServer website to see if there are any binaries available that meet these 
requirements.

Setting up a WFS-client Mapfile
===============================

Storing Temporary Files
-----------------------

You must set the :ref:`IMAGEPATH <web>` parameter in your mapfile since MapServer uses this 
directory to store temporary files downloaded from the remote WFS server.

.. code-block:: mapfile

    MAP
      ...
      WEB
        IMAGEPATH "/tmp/ms_tmp/"
        IMAGEURL ...
      END
      ...
    END 
  
WFS Layer
---------

A WFS layer is a regular mapfile layer, which can use CLASS objects, with 
expressions, etc.

As of MapServer 4.4, the suggested method to define a WFS Client layer is through 
the CONNECTION parameter and the layer's METADATA.  The necessary mapfile parameters 
are defined below:

- *CONNECTIONTYPE*: must be "wfs"
- *CONNECTION*: The URL to the WFS Server. e.g. http://www2.dmsolutions.ca/cgi-bin/mswfs_gmap? 
  The path to the mapfile on the WFS server is required if it was required in the 
  GetCapabilities request e.g. you would have to specify the MAP parameter in the 
  CONNECTION for the following server:
  `http://map.ns.ec.gc.ca/MapServer/mapserv.exe?MAP=/mapserver/services/envdat/config.map`_
  `&SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities`_
- *METADATA*: The LAYER's must contain a METADATA object with the following parameters:

  - *wfs_connectiontimeout* (optional): The maximum time to wait for a remote 
    WFS layer to load, set in seconds (default is 30 seconds). This metadata 
    can be added at the layer level so that it affects only that layer, or it 
    can be added at the map level (in the web object) so that it affects all of 
    the layers. Note that wfs_connectiontimeout at the layer level has priority 
    over the map level.
  - *wfs_filter*: This can be included to include a filter encoding parameter 
    in the getFeature request (see the :ref:`Filter Encoding Howto <filter_encoding>` for more information 
    on filtering).  The content of the wfs_filter is a valid filter encoding element.
    
    .. _`http://map.ns.ec.gc.ca/MapServer/mapserv.exe?MAP=/mapserver/services/envdat/config.map`: http://map.ns.ec.gc.ca/MapServer/mapserv.exe?MAP=/mapserver/services/envdat/config.map&SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities
    .. _`&SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities`: http://map.ns.ec.gc.ca/MapServer/mapserv.exe?MAP=/mapserver/services/envdat/config.map&SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

    .. code-block:: mapfile

      ...
      METADATA
        "wfs_filter"   "<PropertyIsGreaterThan><PropertyName>POP_RANGE</PropertyName><Literal>4
                        </Literal></PropertyIsGreaterThan>"
      END
      ...
  
  - *wfs_latlongboundingbox* (optional): The bounding box of this layer in 
    geographic coordinates in the format "lon_min lat_min lon_max lat_max". If 
    it is set then MapServer will request the layer only when the map view 
    overlaps that bounding box. You normally get this from the server's 
    capabilities output.
  - *wfs_maxfeatures* (optional): Limit the number of GML features to return.
  - *wfs_request_method* (optional): Can be set to "GET" to do a Get request 
    to WFS servers that do not support Post requests.  The default method in 
    MapServer is Post.
    
    .. code-block:: mapfile
    
      ...
      METADATA
        "wfs_filter"   "GET"
      END
      ...

  - *wfs_typename* (required): the <Name> of the layer found in the GetCapabilities. 
    An example GetCapabilities request is:
    `http://www2.dmsolutions.ca/cgi-bin/mswfs_gmap?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=getcapabilities`__
    
    __ http://www2.dmsolutions.ca/cgi-bin/mswfs_gmap?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=getcapabilities
  
  - *wfs_version* (required): WFS version, currently "1.0.0"
  
.. Note:: Each of the above metadata can also be referred to as 'ows_*' instead 
          of 'wfs_*'.  MapServer tries the 'wfs_*' metadata first, and if not 
          found it tries the corresponding 'ows_*' name.  Using this reduces
          the amount of duplication in mapfiles that support multiple OGC 
          interfaces since "ows_*" metadata can be used almost everywhere for 
          common metadata items shared by multiple OGC interfaces. 
          
Example WFS Layer
-----------------

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      NAME "park"
      TYPE POLYGON
      STATUS ON
      CONNECTIONTYPE WFS
      CONNECTION "http://www2.dmsolutions.ca/cgi-bin/mswfs_gmap?"
      METADATA
        "wfs_typename"          "park"
        "wfs_version"           "1.0.0"
        "wfs_request_method"    "GET"
        "wfs_connectiontimeout" "60"
        "wfs_maxfeatures"       "1"
      END
      PROJECTION
        "init=epsg:42304"
      END
      CLASS
        NAME "Parks"
        STYLE
          COLOR 200 255 0
          OUTLINECOLOR 120 120 120
        END
      END
    END # Layer
    
Connection - deprecated
-----------------------

As of MapServer v4.4 the method of specifying all of the connection information 
in the CONNECTION parameter has beendeprecated.  The preferred method is 
mentioned above.  If the metadata is not provided, VERSION, SERVICE, and 
TYPENAME will be fetched from the CONNECTION, as shown below

.. code-block:: mapfile

    CONNECTION    "http://www2.dmsolutions.ca/cgi-bin/mswfs_gmap?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&TYPENAME=park"
    
TODO / Known Limitations
========================

1. Temporary WFS (gml) files are written to the IMAGEPATH directory, but this
   could become a security concern since it makes the raw GML data downloadable 
   by someone who could guess the gml filename.  We should consider having a
   "wfs_cache_dir" metadata that, if it is set will define a directory where temp
   files should be written.  The default would still be to use the value of
   IMAGEPATH if "wfs_tmpdir" is not set.
   
2. Xerces is an annoying dependency for GML support in OGR.  There have been
   discussions about modifying the OGR GML driver to use in internal XML parser 
   by default.  This would save us from the Xerces dependency. There is no formal 
   plan for when this would happen yet.
