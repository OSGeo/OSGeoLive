live_reveal
===========

Project to implement a "LIVE" reveal version for the IPython notebook.

As you now... I like IPython and Reveal.js.

Previously, I developed an "converter" for the IPython.nbconvert lib to export ipynb to STATIC html slideshow based in Reveal.js library.

Now, you a have a non-STATIC version, instead a LIVE version... I mean, a notebook rendered as a Reveal.js-based slideshow, where you can execute code... (or show to the audience whatever you can do inside the notebook, but in a nicer way).

NOTE_1: This is the first version (0.1) presented as an extension, but my aim is to integrate it to the IPython project, so probably the codebase will change a lot with the report of bugs and recommendations from you to make it better...

NOTE_2: I am learning JS to do that, so probably the code is very ugly... I will try to improve it... the good notice is that: it works ;-)

NOTE_3: In the custom.js you have the possibility to configure (for more details check the source, it is easy...):

  * theme
  * transition
  * font-size
 
NOTE_4: You have an ipynb presentation as a gist: https://gist.github.com/damianavila/6345426. You can test the extension with it or use it as a template... or make your own ;-)

NOTE_5: I am touching your ipynb in a "dirty" way... so, for now, make a backup of your ipynb to prevent any damage to it (I tested with no problems for several days, but who knows... it is better to prevent problems).

NOTE_6: I am assuming that you know how to install the extension... if not, probably is better for you to wait a little, but if you want to try it anyway... follow this steps with the appropriate changes: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/fperez/nb-slideshow-template/master/install-support.ipynb

NOTE_7: Use spacebar to go forward and shift+spacebar to go backward (or the controller in the bottom right corner). Up and Down arrows are reserved to interact with notebook cells.
 
NOTE_8: There are some issues in firefox (if you use it, please report me any issue because I want to support both browsers), so I recommend to use Chromium/Chrome during your talks ;-) 

OK, we will keep in touch.

Dami√°n.
