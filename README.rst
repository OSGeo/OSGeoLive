OSGeo live installation scripts
===============================
OSGeo-Live_ is a self-contained bootable DVD, USB thumb drive or Virtual Machine based on Lubuntu, that allows you to try a wide variety of open source geospatial software without installing anything. It is composed entirely of free software, allowing it to be freely distributed, duplicated and passed around.

The set of scripts in this repository will make a GIS Virtual
Machine or bootable ISO from a base Lubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) system.

Running:
~~~~~~~~

You can install individual applications in the base Lubuntu system by running bin/install*sh scripts.

Up to date instructions on building a VM or an ISO image are given at:
